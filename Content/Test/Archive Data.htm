        <h1>Archive Data</h1>
        <p>Archiving enables you to save data that does not change over time as program versions and calculations change. By archiving your project you can save economic, technical, entity, and project data. See <MadCap:xref href="../Create, Convert and Open Projects/Create an Archive.htm#Create_an_Archive">Create an Archive</MadCap:xref> for more details.</p>
        <p>You can also report on archive data in archive reports and compare archives to your current project or to other archives. See <MadCap:xref href="../Create, Convert and Open Projects/Compare Archives.htm#Compare_Archives">Compare Archives</MadCap:xref>. </p>
