        <h1>Common Termination Entity</h1>
        <p>A common termination entity (CTE) consists of at least one well and one facility (cost entity) in the same field. Creating a CTE enables you to determine the economic limit of the field by ignoring well-level economic limits and calculating the economics for all the wells and facilities as one entity. </p>
        <p>You can add a CTE to another CTE or Ring Fence Entity by right clicking the CTE in the explorer and selecting <b>Add to</b> &gt; <b>CTE</b> or <b>Add to</b> &gt; <b>Ring Fence Entity</b>. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">Creating a CTE involves the three basic steps below. See the following sections for more details.</p>
