        <h1>Use Back and Forward Buttons</h1>
        <p>Using the Back and Forward buttons in the toolbar moves you back and forward through your navigation history. Each time you use the back button you are returned to your previous context. A context consists of an entity, tab selection, reserves category, resource category, archive, and plan. Twenty contexts are saved in your navigation history. Once you exceed twenty contexts, the oldest context is removed and the most recent context is added. </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>The context list is cleared when you close a project or apply a filter to the project. </li>
            <li>The Comparison tab's pinned items are not saved in the navigation history. </li>
            <li>Use <b>Alt + Left Arrow</b> and <b>Alt + Right Arrow</b> for shortcut keys. </li>
        </ul>
