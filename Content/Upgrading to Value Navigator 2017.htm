        <h1>Upgrading to  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018</h1>
        <p>When you open an older <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> project (version 6 or higher) in  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018, it is converted to 2018 automatically. </p>
        <div class="Caution"> SQL Server and Oracle databases upgrade "in place" which means you should have your database administrator make a backup copy of server projects before you upgrade them. <br />When you upgrade a SQLite database, a backup of the original project is automatically created and saved in the same folder.</div>
        <p>If you are upgrading a  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 5.2 project, please contact <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> .</p>
