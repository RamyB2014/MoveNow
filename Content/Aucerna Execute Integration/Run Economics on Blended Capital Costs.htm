        <h1>Run Economics on Blended Capital Costs</h1>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> you can run economics on forecasted capital costs or blended capital costs. Blended capital costs are a mix of forecasted and actual costs. You can only run economics on blended capital costs if you have imported actual capital costs from AFENav or another source. </p>
        <p>You can run economics on blended capital costs by selecting <b>Run Economics on Blended Costs</b> in the <b>Project Options</b>, under <b>Economics</b>. Economics are run on forecasted capital costs by default (<b>Run economics on forecast only</b> option).</p>
        <p>You can view forecasted and actual capital costs on <b>Economics | Prices &amp; Costs | Capital Costs</b>. To see the forecasted and actual costs, select <b>Forecast and Actuals</b> in the <b>View</b> list. The green column displays actuals. </p>
        <p>The suggested forecast is displayed below the <b>End of Actuals</b> line. If the suggested forecast is negative, you have spent more than you forecasted.</p>
        <p>You can filter to overspent entities by creating a filter with <i>Has Capital Overspend= True</i>. See <MadCap:xref href="../Create a Filter Query.htm#Create_a_Filter_Query">Create a Filter Query</MadCap:xref>. </p>
