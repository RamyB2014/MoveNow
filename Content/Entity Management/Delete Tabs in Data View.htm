        <h1>Delete Tabs in Data View </h1>
        <p>You can only delete a subtab, not a top level tab (Group Tab). However, if you delete all of a Group Tab’s subtabs, the Group Tab is also deleted automatically. </p>
        <p>To delete a subtab in the <MadCap:xref href="Switch between the Entity View and Data View.htm#Switch_between_the_Entity_View_and_Data_View" target="_popup">Data View</MadCap:xref>, click the X on the tab. </p>
