        <h1>Enter GCI Depth</h1>
        <p>To enter the GCI (gross completion interval) depth, go to <b>Economics | Interests &amp; Royalties</b>. </p>
        <p>For wells in Alberta, the GCI (gross completion interval) is used to calculate the depth factor (DF). A depth factor is calculated based on the measured depth (MD), according to the records of the ERCB for that well event.</p>
        <p>For a well event, the MD is defined as the longest distance, in meters, along the bore of the well (horizontally and/or vertically) from the Kelly bushing of the well event to the bottom of the gross completion interval (GCI) from which the well event is producing.</p>
        <p>The DF is used in the determination of the quantity component (rq) of the royalty rate, for measured depths (MD) that exceed 2000 meters.</p>
        <p>The DF for a well event is determined based on the following formula:</p>
        <p>DF = (MD / 2000) 2</p>
        <p>If MD &lt;= 2,000m, then DF = 1.0 (minimum DF)</p>
        <p>If MD &gt; 2,000m and &lt; 4,000m, then DF = (MD / 2000) 2</p>
        <p>If MD &gt;= 4,000m, then DF = 4.0 (maximum DF)</p>
        <p>The GCI depth can be loaded with production data.</p>
