        <h1>Enable Automated Reserves Reconciliation</h1>
        <p>In new <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018 (or later) projects, automated reserves reconciliation (ARR) is enabled by default. However, in projects upgraded to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018, ARR is not enabled by default.</p>
        <div class="Note"> You can only enable ARR on upgraded projects with data in the Accepted plan.</div>
        <p>When you enable ARR, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> needs to create an archive of your project which it then uses as a basis for tracking changes. You can choose to create a new archive or map to an existing archive. If you choose to create a new archive, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> creates an archive called <i>[Jurisdiction name] - [Ref Date]</i>.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To enable ARR</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <b>Tools</b> &gt; <b>Options</b> &gt; <b>Project Options</b> &gt; <b>Reserves</b>.</li>
            <li>	Click <b>Enable Automated Reserves Reconciliation</b>.</li>
            <li>	In the Enable Automated Reserves Reconciliation dialog box, for each jurisdiction, select the archive you want to map to, if applicable. Otherwise, <i>Create a new archive</i> is applied automatically.</li>
            <li>	Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note"> When you upgrade a project with an Accepted plan, you’ll see a tool tip in the Summary window (bottom left) indicating that change records are being inherited from a higher plan.</div>
