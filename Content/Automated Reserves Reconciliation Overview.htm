        <h1>Automated Reserves Reconciliation Overview</h1>
        <p>Automated reserves reconciliation (ARR) is designed to simplify reconciliations by eliminating the need to manually create a change record each time you modify an entity. With ARR enabled, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> detects the changes you made and creates all the required change records when you click Reconcile.</p>
        <p>For example, with non-automated reserves reconciliation, you should create a Change Record (and specify the Change Record Category) after each type of change that you make in order to document the changes separately. With ARR, you can make several types of changes and then click Reconcile. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will create separate Change Records for each change type and automatically determine the Change Record Category to use.</p>
        <h2>Upgraded vs. New Projects</h2>
        <p>Automated reserves reconciliation (ARR) is enabled by default in any project created in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018 or later (you can still create change records manually). However, ARR is not enabled by default in any project upgraded to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018 or later. For upgraded projects, you must enable ARR in the project options.
