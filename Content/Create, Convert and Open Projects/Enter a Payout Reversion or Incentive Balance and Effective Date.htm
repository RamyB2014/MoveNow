        <h1>Enter a Payout Reversion or Incentive Balance and Effective Date</h1>
        <p>You can enter a payout reversion value or incentive balance and specify the date at which it is effective on <b>Economics | Interests &amp; Royalties. </b>See <MadCap:xref href="Enter Reversions.htm#Enter_Reversions">Enter Reversions</MadCap:xref><b> or </b><MadCap:xref href="../Select Incentives.htm#Select_Incentives">Select Incentives</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Effective Date and the Economic Calculation Start Date</h2>
        <p>You can set the Effective Date to be on or after the Economic Calculation Start Date specified in Project Options. An Effective Date prior to the Calculation Start Date will be ignored and the Calculation Start Date will be used in calculations.</p>
        <p>The Effective Date you enter for a payout reversion or incentive is affected by the Economic Calculation Start Date in the following ways: </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>
                If you move the Economic Calculation Start Date to be later than the Effective Date of any entities, you should adjust the Effective Dates and associated values or balances to be equal to or later than the Economic Calculation Start Date. Otherwise, the Effective Date will be ignored, and balances will be decremented as of the Economic Calculation Start Date.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you return the Economic Calculation Start Date back to a point on or before the Effective Date, the balance is decremented from the Effective Date again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Balances are not automatically adjusted when you move the Economic Calculation Start Date. If balances are removed or adjusted, they cannot be restored.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Payout Reversion and Incentive Behaviour</h2>
        <p>If you enter an Effective Date for a payout reversion or an incentive: </p>
        
			
                Payout reversions are only calculated using the Reversion Value you enter. All prior capital entered on the case is ignored. If the Effective Date is not entered, capital entered on the case will be included.
         
                Incentives are assumed to be in place in all calculation steps prior to the Effective Date. The balance entered on the case is decremented from that date. The incentive is not capped at a maximum value.
           
        <h2>Reporting on Effective Dates and Balances</h2><p>Use the <b>Calc. Date Adjustment Report</b> to identify entities affected by a change to the Economic Calculation Start Date. </p><p>Use the <b>Remaining Balance—Incentives and Remaining Balance—Reversions</b> reports to display remaining balances as of the Reference Date. </p></body>
