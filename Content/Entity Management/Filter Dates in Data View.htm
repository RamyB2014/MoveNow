        <h1>Filter Dates in Data View</h1>
        <p>You can specify a date range for a Date row in the Data Views Layout Panel by clicking the arrow on the right and selecting start and end dates.</p>
        <p>You can also use this date range to view dates for which there is no data yet. To do this, specify the date extension you want to display in the grid and select All (from Inputs Only/Show Gaps/All).&#160; Selecting All enables you to add data to date ranges not yet existing in your database.</p>
