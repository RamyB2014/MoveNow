        <h1>Enter Capital Costs</h1>
        <p>Enter capital costs on <b>Economics | Prices &amp; Costs | Capital Costs</b>. When you enter capital costs, enter the gross amount. The working interest share is calculated according to the percentage entered for <b>Capital Cost Interest</b> on <b>Economics | Interests &amp; Royalties</b>. See <MadCap:xref href="Enter a Working Interest.htm#Enter_a_Working_Interest" target="_popup">Enter a Working Interest</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p>Inflation is applied to each cost according to the capital cost inflation rate entered in the Price Deck Editor. The default inflation rate is zero. See <MadCap:xref href="Edit Inflation.htm#Edit_Inflation">Edit Inflation</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>By default, all capital costs after the economic calculation date are included in the payout reversion calculation. However, you can exclude a capital cost from the payout reversion calculation (or apply a multiple) using the Reversion Factor. See the procedure below. </p>
        <div class="Note">When entering abandonment or salvage costs on a well with no forecast, you must enter the costs as an <MadCap:xref href="Entity Management/Override Inherited Values.htm#Override_Inherited_Values" target="_popup">override</MadCap:xref> in any reserves category other than <MadCap:xref href="Entity Management/Understanding the Common Reserves Category.htm#Understanding_the_Common_Reserves_Category" target="_popup">Common</MadCap:xref>. When abandonment and salvage are entered in Common on a well with no forecast, the costs are not calculated and do not appear in reports. </div>
        <p>You can enter capital costs in three categories: Common, Success and Failure. Under these categories, you can select Working Interest or Facility Interest costs. Under these categories, costs are organized by type. </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li><b>Common costs</b>: incurred regardless of success or failure. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Success costs</b>: incurred only if the project is successful.
            </li>
            <li><b>Failure costs</b>: incurred only if the project fails. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Working Interest costs</b>: costs that a company has an interest in. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Facility Interest costs</b>: costs for a facility that a company has an interest in. 
            </li>

            <li>
                You can rename costs by typing in the <b>Name</b> field at the top of the column. However, this does not rename this cost for the entire project.
