        <h1>Calculation Date Adjustment Report</h1>
        <p>Running the Calculation Date Adjustment Report either displays a report that lists all the entities that may have values that need to be adjusted after the project has been posted or it filters the project to those entities. This report should be printed before running a reserves reconciliation. </p>
        <p>Economic data from all relevant reserves categories must be current to produce accurate results. If economic data is not current when you run a reserves report, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> runs economics automatically when you run the report. However, if you want to run reserves economics before running the reserves report, you must run the <i>Reserves Options Scenario</i> on the <b>Reports</b> tab or in the Batch Manager for the entities you want to report on. If you run the <i>Reserves Options Scenario</i> prior to running reserves reports, the reports automatically detect this and will not run it again, resulting in faster display of the report. Running the <i>Default Scenario</i> does not necessarily generate the economic results required to run reserves reports.</p>
