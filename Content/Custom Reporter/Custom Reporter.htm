        <h1>Custom Reporter </h1>
        <p>The Custom Reporter can be used to create Table or Graph reports, on Economic or Technical output. Reports can be based on filters and consist of several predefined objects resulting in reports that only display output from certain reserves categories, statuses, or scenarios. </p>
        <h2>Working with Custom Reports </h2>
        <p>When creating custom reports, keep the following points in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always run Economics before running an economic custom report to ensure the economic data is current.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>When creating custom reports, always add filters to limit the reserves categories and reserves statuses.
