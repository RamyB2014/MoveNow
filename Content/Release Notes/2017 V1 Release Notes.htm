        <h1>2017 V1 Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>The focus of 2017 is Inventory Scheduling.  This includes many new features that all act together to provide the ability to schedule new wells.  Users can create incremental additions to base forecasts, relate them to a start date, and visualize additions to existing production and see constraints.  These views can be saved as Schedules, and can easily be modified, either visually or via Data Views.</p>
        <p>For further information on 2017 Features, refer to the Spotlight documents included for the Release.</p>
        <h3>Incremental Forecasts</h3>
        <p>A major improvement in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2017 is the ability to define workover segments for declines and capital.  The workover feature allows you to define a base forecast and then increment future work without having to re-define the total forecast.  Now you can simply define the work you are about to do.  Use the ‘Forecast mode’ selection on a well to define whether it will be using a base forecast with incremental segments, or will still use the classic behaviour we have labeled ‘Total’ mode.  All wells in previous versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will upgrade to Total mode in 2017 with no change in forecasted volumes.  Incremental or Total forecast mode is an entity level setting, not per reserves category.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/incrforecast.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Not only can you create incremental segments, you can also decide how they relate to the base forecast, either by specifying an absolute change, or by using a relative change that is based on the transition date of the new segment.  For example, a 350% increment will factor the rate at the transition point (t) by 350% which means that no matter when your workover starts, the new Qi will always be a relative increment.</p>
        <p>Capital works the same way, where capital costs in the base forecast can be seen in TP, where you can add additional capital that represents new work only.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/incrcap.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Here you can see all the costs that make up the TP case, while only having to input the capital associated with the workover in TP.</p>
        <h3>Common Reserves Category</h3>
        <p>Users frequently describe their incremental work to us in terms of their ‘base forecast’ plus new additional work.  We’ve adopted that terminology and so we renamed the ‘Base’ reserves category to ‘Common’, which is still where you enter inputs common to all categories.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/coomrescat.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Project Start Date</h3>
        <p>Now that you can easily create workover forecasts, you can also easily adjust them in time. Project Start is a method of anchoring all Res Cat level date inputs to a single anchor so that all inputs can be adjusted at once.  When Project Start is adjusted, all date inputs on the Res Cat are adjusted by the same amount.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/projectstart.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Project Start can be set per Res Cat on the Declines tab (add it from the hamburger menu  ) or, bulk edit these dates in Data Views. A new default Project Start grid displays Project Start, as well as read-only Forecast Start date and first capital input date.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/projectstart2.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Timeline Tab</h3>
        <p>The Timeline tab is a new feature designed to visualise and allow drag and drop editing of Project Start dates.</p>
        <p>The top graph displays production and capital data for all entities in the current hierarchy selection, which allows you to see current production along with scheduled additions.</p>
        <p>The bottom gantt-chart control allows users to drag Project Start dates for scheduled additions.</p>
        <p>The Options panel configures display options and allows users to create constraints on product and capital values.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Constraints are displayed along with the product series on the graph.</li>
            <li>Entities in the current hierarchy selection with current production are indicated as contributing entities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/timeline.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>New Entity Type: Schedules</h3>
        <p>Schedules are a way to make projects easy to manage.  They will also be the basis for future scheduling enhancements in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The existing Bulk Well Schedule tool has been renamed: Bulk Well Generator</li>
            <li>All the functionality remains, but will be transitioned to Schedules along with new features in future releases.</li>
            <li>Schedules are a new entity type, and can be created from the entity menus, or from the Data Views &gt; Timeline tab (Create as Schedule button).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/schedule.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Support for Multiple Products</h3>
        <p>Another way of working more effectively is the ability to work with all products at once. Multi-product support has been added to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Best fit forecasting on secondary products</li>
            <li>Best fit forecasting on custom products</li>
            <li>Workspace tab</li>
            <li>Type Wells</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Best Fit Forecasting on Secondary Products</h3>
        <p>In previous versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the Best Fit routines were only available for the primary product on any well. A 1+WOR fit was also available for oil wells.</p>
        <p>In 2017, the fitting routines are available on products regardless of whether they are primary or secondary.  Fitting is not available for ratios.</p>
        <p>Best Fits can be generated for any product selected under ‘Products to fit:’ in the Best Fit and Refit dialogues.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/secpro.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Best Fit Forecasting on Custom Products</h3>
        <p>Best Fit functionality is now available on any product with liquid volume or gas volume unit types.  Best Fits can be generated for any product selected under ‘Products to fit:’ in the Best Fit and Refit dialogues.</p>
        <p>Custom Products will show up in the Best Fit list if they are flagged as ‘Allow decline’ and ‘Allow fitting’ in the Products dialogue.</p>
        <p>The Product option ‘Allow final segment incline on fit’ will stream a product fit through the 1+WOR routine, so the forecast is not forced to decline.</p>
        <p>Product Specific fit settings can be entered in User Options for all fit-able products.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/custompro.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Predictions | Workspace tab – All products</h3>
        <p>In conjunction with allowing fits on all products, we have included these products on the Workspace tab in a multi-product display.</p>
        <p>Select the products to view from the Products dropdown in the graph.</p>
        <p>The baseline selection highlights all product rows for the selected forecast key configuration.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/allpro.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Type Wells – All Products</h3>
        <p>The functionality of Type Wells has been expanded to support forecasts on multiple products.</p>
        <p>The Type Well - Options dialogue has a new Product selection, which displays all products associated with the selected Product List.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/twallpro.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Multi-ResCat Reports</h3>
        <p>In previous versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the Report Designer worked with values returned from a single economic context at a time. We can now report multiple reserve category results on the same report, and run them from the Reports tab.  This allows users to show different cashflows for example, or provide summary info (1P, 2P, 3P, for instance) on one-line summary reports.</p>
        <p>A group method has been added to Hierarchy tables in the Report Designer. The control allows for reserves category selections at the total (e.g. Probable) major level, or detailed (e.g. Probable Additional Undeveloped) minor level.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/multirescat.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are new reports added to the built-in report selection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Area Property Report - Co. Share, NPV by Res. Cat.</li>
            <li>Area Property Report - Net &amp; NPV by Res. Cat.</li>
            <li>Area Property Report - WI &amp; NPV by Res. Cat.</li>
            <li>Cash Flow Summary by Res. Cat.</li>
            <li>Gross Lease Reserves by Res. Cat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <h3>Project option for Negative Revenue</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Previous versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> reported negative revenue resulting from a net negative product price as an operating cost.  There is now a project option in the Economics section to report this results stream as negative sales revenue.</li>
            <li>Project Options &gt; Economics – ‘Report negative product revenue as operating costs ‘</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Gross Overriding Royalties with Deductions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added the ability to tag operating costs as GOR Deductible. The costs are offset against a gross overriding royalty, optionally up to a limit specified on Interest Properties (GOR Deduction Cap %)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/grossor.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Default inputs are now written to the database</h3>
        <p>Previous versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> would create economic results even though users did not specifically create any inputs other than a forecast.  Input tabs displayed default values even though they were not written to the database. This caused confusion when validating inputs and results.  For example, a 100% working interest was always used until a user changed the value.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Default inputs are now written to the database on entity creation.  Queries against Interests, Price Sets, Allowances, and General Economics options will always return values.</li>
            <li>Because they are now written to the entity, the default values are immediately visible on Data Views grids.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Condensate added to Daily Data</h3>
        <p>Condensate has been added to products available for Daily Data and integrated into the following tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Import via a custom Data Source connection</li>
            <li>Import via the Spreadsheet Import tool</li>
            <li>View on the Data &gt; Daily tab</li>
            <li>Administration &gt; Data Cleanup &gt; Convert Oil/Condensate now works for Daily Data</li>
            <li>Available as a series on graphs</li>
            <li>Included in reports</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Price Factors in Scenarios</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a simple method for scaling entity level prices in Scenarios.</li>
            <li>Use ‘Price Factor %’ in the Sensitivity section to factor entity price and royalty prices in a scenario calculation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Additions to Accumap (.vna) files</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added Surface latitude and longitude to the file; both surface and bottomhole are now available.</li>
            <li>Added Zone information</li>
            <li>Added License Number</li>
            <li>Additional product data is now supported, and imported for wells with those products in their Product List:</li>
            <li>Steam (Accumap Import Code 250,9)</li>
            <li>CO2 (250,10)</li>
            <li>Fluid (250,11)</li>
            <li>Inj. Steam (260,9)</li>
            <li>Inj. Oil (260,10)</li>
            <li>Inj. Polymer (260,11)</li>
            <li>Inj. CO2 (260,12)</li>
            <li>Inj. Air (260,13)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Net Operating Income by NPV in Report Designer</h3>
        <p>Added new Cash Flow data fields to the Report Designer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Net Operating Income NPV1</li>
            <li>Net Operating Income NPV2</li>
            <li>Net Operating Income NPV3</li>
            <li>Net Operating Income NPV4</li>
            <li>Net Operating Income NPV5</li>
            <li>Net Operating Income NPV Auto</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Price Deck Labels</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Inflation settings have been moved from Tax Rates into a new Inflation section</li>
            <li>General Inflation has been renamed ‘Inflation of Price Differentials’</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Delete Capital Actuals</h3>
        <p>There is a new option under the Administration &gt; Data Cleanup menu - Delete Capital Actuals.  This was previously supplied as a plug-in to clients who link to actual capital costs in AFE’s.</p>
        <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue with upgrades from 2016 v2 where a project would fail to upgrade.  Projects with some unsolvable O+W forecasts were not processed correctly.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in the Bulk Well Generator (previously Bulk Well Schedule) tool did not correctly set start of forecast for all products.  The start date for the primary product is now set to the date generated by the tool, and offsets are honored for other products.</li>
            <li>Modified the behavior of the Bulk Well Generator tool so that only date values for inputs on forecasted ResCats are adjusted when wells are generated. Date values in the Common input category will not be adjusted.  This includes gas liquids forecasts in the Plant tab.</li>
            <li>Modified the Copy ResCat and Advanced Copy tools to handle incremental forecasts.</li>
            <li>If an incremental segment is moved to PDP, then the resolved decline is copied. The new forecast in PDP is an exact copy of the source.</li>
            <li>If an incremental segment is copied to another non-PDP ResCat then only the ResCat inputs are copied.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where Well Type was incorrectly set on a production import.  Now we honor the type in the data source rather than calculating the type based on a ratio of oil and gas volumes.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with importing production from .vna files that resulted in some wells incorrectly designated as injection.  The presence of a single row of injection data would re-set Well Type, because the production data had already been processed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Economic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed issues regarding royalty cost deductions on freehold and gross overriding royalty interests:</li>
            <li>WI Variable T+T Cost (Roy. Deduct) was not functioning correctly for any receivable FH or GOR in all provinces (AB, BC, SK &amp; MB)</li>
            <li>The Custom Processing Fee was not applied to FH payable or receivable on BC entities</li>
            <li>PCOS in BC was not being applied to receivable FH and GOR interests.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where Abandonment entered on the Economics | General tab was being factored by the Working Interest instead of the Capital Cost Interest.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in Ring Fence calculations where the Average WI was not calculated using tract and pooling factors. When the WorkingInterestRevenueTotal was calculated, the whole gross revenue for each lease was added, ignoring the fact that it might need to be factored. This only affected calculations in a ring fence.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in Custom Regime calculations.  When the Apply Economic Limit flag was turned off on child entities, the Delayed Abandonment value was not included in some regime formulas.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where some wells were incorrectly dropped out of Ring Fence or CTE results.  This would happen when a well started off uneconomic, but became economic at some later date, but after the Ring Fence or CTE economic limit.  In Ring Fences the dropped well was contributing to the aggregate values, and being allocated to, but not showing up in the results. The allocated totals couldn’t be properly accounted for.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with the Adjust Dates tool where Alberta Re-Entry Date and Manitoba Project Implementation Date were not adjusted.</li>
            <li>Updated Alberta MRF calculations with minor changes announced in November 2016. Specifically, the formulas have been updated for:</li>
            <li>Propane (extracted and in stream components) trigger points changed very slightly</li>
            <li>Butane (extracted and in stream components) trigger points changed very slightly</li>
            <li>the Y coefficient in the Drilling and Completion Cost Allowance (C*) for new wells and wells re-entered changed to use TVDavg instead of TVDmax.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue that could occur when creating wells from the Bulk Well Generator.  When capital costs occurred before the production forecast, the scheduled wells could have forecasts that didn’t start on the first day of the month (31st, 1st, or 3rd depending on the month).  This caused issues because there could be a tiny amount of production in the first scheduled month, which counts as a full month of production for Allowable Month calculations on incentives.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reporting and Graphs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue with inputs in child plans where a linked ResCat with no input was falling back incorrectly.  The economic calculation will now resolve to a parent plan's ResCat input if there is no input in the linked child plan.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in Batch Manager - Scenario Reports.  In some cases, the scenario name and result value did not match. The scenario comparison reports are now shown properly with respect to the scenario list created by the user.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue on the Comparison tab where the ‘Last year for monthly output’ setting was different in an archive than for current options. In this case the Comparison tab graph would display a spike in the archive series data.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue on the Comparison tab where the Reference Date was different in an archive than for current options. In this case the Comparison tab graph would display a drop to zero in the archive series data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue where economic calculations for Common Termination and Ring Fence entities would run too many times.  Parent/child Plan relationships are now handled correctly.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where a project database could close with an error.  Now there is a check for active connections when closing projects.</li>
            <li>Fixed an error that could occur when a Plan was renamed and then removed entirely.</li>
            <li>Fixed a crash that occurred on some copy/paste operations: “Requested Clipboard operation did not succeed” or “"OpenClipboard Failed”.  This situation can still occur when another application is locking the clipboard, but it will not cause a crash.</li>
            <li>Fixed a crash that could occur when creating new wells “System.InvalidCastException”.  This could occur when a user was resting on a hidden entity node in a filter set when the new well was created.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in the Spreadsheet Import tool where the User Option &gt; Decline display setting was not honored.  Values were imported as tangent instead of secant.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in the Spreadsheet Import tool. The spreadsheet import showed a date format selector, even when the column was formatted as date type in Excel. It then used the date value when importing, regardless of the format string selected by the user.  This could result in dates being imported improperly.  Now the import formatting is supressed if the source values are all dates.  It is available for text, general, and custom values.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in the Data &gt; Wellhead tab grid where the date mode allowed annual values.  The Annual selection should not be available on this tab.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue in log files where multiple warning lines were generated.  For example:</li>
            <li>(Warning) Error getting server time.</li>
            <li>(Warning) The fiscal item Yukon Corporate Tax Rate specified by the custom calculation was not found in the price deck - an empty tax rate will be used.</li>
            <li>(Warning) The fiscal item QC Resource Tax Credit specified by the custom calculation was not found in the price deck - an empty tax rate will be used.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where performance in economic runs was very slow due to excessive log file events being generated, possibly triggering system level anti-virus protection:</li>
            <li>(Warning) Error loading GenericIncentiveWithSubtypesData. Trying base class.</li>
            <li>(Information) The specified id {34a75c27-9ea6-4918-96f2-98eb01d7d947} was not found in the price collection. No value could be determined for this price.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where performance in economic runs was very slow due to missing Par Prices for Alberta wells.  The log file returned the following message:</li>
            <li>(Information) The specified price AB Par Price (C3 or C4) was not found in the resolved price collection - the price was likely excluded from the list of prices used in the custom calculation object. The price was resolved on demand but this may impact performance.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue that could occur if a 6.6 project database, with Alberta MRF data and multiple archives, could crash on upgrade to 2016 v2.</li>
            <li>Fixed a crash that occurred on the Map when a null value was detected in Data Visualizations.</li>
            <li>Object reference not set to an instance of an object.</li>
            <li>Fixed a crash in SQL Server databases that could result from calculating Lateral Length on a production import.  The calculation returned NaN (Not a Number) which is not supported in SQL Server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
