        <h1>Find and Update Wells Linked to a Type Well</h1>
        <p>When you have edited a type well’s forecast, you must update any wells linked to the type well because the new type well forecast is not automatically applied to any linked wells. Use the procedure below to display all the wells linked to a type well and update their forecasts.</p>
