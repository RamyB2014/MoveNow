        <h1>Import/Update Actual Costs from AFENav </h1>
        <p>Before importing or updating actuals from AFENav, you must configure AFENav and ValNav integration. </p>
        <p>When you import actuals, they are displayed on <b>Economics | Prices &amp; Costs | Capital Costs </b>with a green background. Actuals are not editable in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and are not used in economic calculations. Actuals provide information that can be used to make a more accurate capital cost forecast, which is used in economic calculations. </p>
        <p>To display actuals, you must select <b>Forecasts and Actuals</b> from the <b>View</b> list in the top left. </p>
        <div class="Note"> If actuals are displayed with a red background, it means the actuals are not correctly mapped to a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> cost type. Contact your administrator to fix the error. </div>
        <p>The blue line indicates the end of actuals. The difference between your forecasted cost and the actual cost is displayed below <b>the End of Actuals</b> line. This is the suggested forecast. If the suggested forecast is negative, you have spent more than you forecasted and should update the forecast to match the actuals. </p>
        <p>Economics are run on forecasted capital costs by default (<b>Run economics on forecast only</b> option), but you can run economics on blended capital costs by selecting <b>Run Economics on Blended Costs</b> in the Project Options, under Economics. See <MadCap:xref href="Run Economics on Blended Capital Costs.htm#Run_Economics_on_Blended_Capital_Costs">Run Economics on Blended Capital Costs</MadCap:xref>.</p>
