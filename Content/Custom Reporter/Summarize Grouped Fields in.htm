        <h1>Summarize Grouped Fields in Custom Table Reports</h1>
        <p>Grouped fields can be displayed as Expanded or Summarized. Summarizing a group allows you to view a summary of the items to report.</p>
        <p>For example, if the group Date is summarized, the report data will be organized by year. If it is expanded, it will be displayed by month. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To summarize a group</p>
        <ol class="Procedure">
            <li>In the Groups window, right-click a group field, point to <b>Expand Group</b> and select <b>Summarized</b>. The summarized group field displays with a blue sigma sign.</li>
            <li>In the Summary Method row of your report, select a summary method for the data that is being summarized. </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note"> If you do not select a summary method from the Summary Method row in the report outline at the bottom of the Edit Current Object tab, data will not be displayed.</div>
        <p>Group Fields can also be nested within each other. This allows you to group your results by two or more fields. See <MadCap:xref href="Group Fields in Custom Table.htm">Group Fields in Custom Table Reports</MadCap:xref>.</p>
