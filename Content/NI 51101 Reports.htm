        <h1>NI 51-101 Reports</h1>
        <p>Economic data from all relevant reserves categories must be current to produce accurate results. If economic data is not current when you run a reserves report, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> runs economics automatically when you run the report. However, if you want to run reserves economics before running the reserves report, you must run the <i>Reserves Options Scenario</i> on the <b>Reports</b> tab or in the Batch Manager for the entities you want to report on. If you run the <i>Reserves Options Scenario</i> prior to running reserves reports, the reports automatically detect this and will not run it again, resulting in faster display of the report. Running the <i>Default Scenario</i> does not necessarily generate the economic results required to run reserves reports.</p>
