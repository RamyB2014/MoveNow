        <h1>Create a Graph Copy </h1>
        <p>The default graphs in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> are read-only graphs. However, you can make a copy of a graph and then edit it in the Graph Designer. </p>
        <p>A graph copy is a “standalone” graph that is different than a graph “version” (versions are related to their original graph). See <MadCap:xref href="Create a Graph Version.htm#Create_a_Graph_Version">Create a Graph Version</MadCap:xref>. </p>
