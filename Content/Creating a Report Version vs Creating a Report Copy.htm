        <h1>Creating a Report Version vs. Creating a Report Copy</h1>
        <p>When you create a report “version” you are creating a report that is related to its original report. The version is not displayed in the report list—only the original report is in the list. When you generate a report, you select the original report in the report list, but the new version is automatically used for any entity that matches its criteria (such as country or regime). </p>
        <p>In addition to creating report versions you can also copy a report and use it to create a report “copy”. The report copy is displayed in the report list and is no longer related to the original—you still need to select it in the report list when you are reporting. </p>
