        <h1>Create Multiple Forecasts on Predictions | Workspace</h1>
        <p><b>Predictions | Workspace</b> enables you to create multiple declines for an entity. You can then choose whether to apply a decline to a well by selecting a plan and reserves category. You can also view multiple forecasts on the same graph for comparison purposes. </p>
        <p>The decline you apply to a plan and reserves category is the active decline. The active decline is displayed with bold text and the Plan and Reserves Category columns are populated. Edits you make to the active decline in the <b>Decline Workspace</b> are also applied to the decline on <b>Predictions | Declines</b> and vice versa. </p>
