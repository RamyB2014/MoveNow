        <h1>Batch Apply a Type Curve to Several Wells</h1>
        <p>Use this procedure to apply a type curve to several wells at once. </p>
        <div class="Note">You can apply the type curve on <b>Predictions | Workspace</b> and preview the change (or compare the change to the original decline) before actually applying the type curve to your wells. See <MadCap:xref href="Edit a Decline on Predictions Workspace.htm#Edit_a_Decline_on_Predictions__Workspace">Edit a Decline on Predictions </MadCap:xref>.&#160;&#160; </div>

                From the <b>Tools</b> menu, select <b>Apply/Remove Type Curve</b>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Under Options, select <b>Apply Type Curve</b> and select <b>Plans</b> (to apply the changes to your project) or <b>Workspace </b>(to preview the changes in Workspace before applying the changes to your project).
            </li>
            <li>
                Select a <b>Source Type Well</b>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Select <b>Scale forecasts when applying</b> if you want to scale the forecast. If you don’t select this option, scaling is turned off (the scaling factor is 1).

            <li>
                Select the <b>Destination Plans</b> and <b>Reserves Categories</b>.

        </ol>
        <p>The type curve is applied to the selected wells in the selected reserves categories. </p>
        <p>When enabled, the <b>Apply Current Filter</b> checkbox applies your project filter to the <b>Destination Entities</b> window in the <b>Apply/Remove Type Curve</b> dialog box. When this checkbox is disabled, your project filter is not applied to the <b>Destination Entities</b> window—all entities are displayed.</p>
