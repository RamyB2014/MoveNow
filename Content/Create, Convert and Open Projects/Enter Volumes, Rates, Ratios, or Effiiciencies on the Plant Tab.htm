        <h1>Enter Volumes, Rates, Ratios, or Effiiciencies on the Plant Tab</h1>
        <p>To enter Natural Gas Liquid (C2-C5+), NGL or Condensate data, such as monthly volume, calendar day rate, or ratio, go to Predictions |Data | Plant.</p>
        <p>For Ratios or Efficiencies, you can enter a Default or Monthly value. For Volumes or Rates you can only enter Monthly values.</p>
        <h2>Entering or Changing a Ratio or Efficiency</h2>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>In the grid view of dates and product yields, enter a rate, volume, ratio or efficiency at any date to adjust the yield. Only one type of override can exist for any product. In other words, you cannot enter ratios for one year, and then volumes for the next year.</li>
            <li>When you enter a rate, volume, or ratio, the cell background turns grey to indicate an entered value.</li>
            <li>When you enter a rate, the volume is automatically calculated and displayed with a grey background. (The opposite is true when you enter a volume.) The calculated ratio or volume is displayed in grey text to indicate it is based on the entered rate or volume.</li>
            <li>When you enter a ratio, the value is automatically applied to all subsequent months. (You can still edit values for the subsequent months.) Volumes and rates are automatically calculated and displayed in grey text to indicate they are based on the entered ratio.</li>
            <li>Process Loss and Energy Content are automatically recalculated, but they can be overridden by entering values. To enter an NGL or Condensate volume, rate, or ratio, one of these columns must be in view, as they cannot be calculated using an Efficiency</li>
        </ul>
