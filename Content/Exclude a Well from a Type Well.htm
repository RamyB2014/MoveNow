        <h1>Exclude a Well from a Type Well</h1>
        <p>Excluding a well from a type well only excludes its data from the type well calculation—it does not remove the well (see <MadCap:xref href="Remove Wells from a Type Well.htm#Remove_Wells_from_a_Type_Well">Remove Wells from a Type Well</MadCap:xref>). When you exclude a well, you can easily include it again or choose to remove it entirely from the type well. </p>
