        <h1>Create a Report Version</h1>
        <p>Report versions are reports based on a source report and related to it. Report versions are variations of their source and are automatically displayed when the selected entity’s criteria match the report’s criteria.</p>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, some reports have versions built in. For example, the Economic Detail-After Tax report has three versions: Canada, US, and Undefined. When you run reports, you do not need to select the Canadian version when reporting on Canadian entities or the US version when reporting on US entities—<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically detects the entity’s country and generates the appropriate report. The Undefined version is automatically used for all other countries.</p>
        <p>With the Report Version Manager, you can create custom versions of economic reports to streamline the reporting process. You can create versions based on country, state or province, regime, regime calculation, or product list. Then when you are reporting on entities with a mix of criteria, you only need to select one report rather than selecting a separate report for each entity. </p>

        <p>Keep in mind that you can only create report versions for economic reports that are editable in the <b>Report Designer</b>. In the <b>Select/Manage Reports</b> dialog box, editable reports are indicated with this icon: <img alt="rd icon.png" src="Resources/Images/image019.png" width="12" height="14" class="InlineImage" />.</p>
