        <h1>Project Options: Royalties and Taxes</h1>
        <h2>Enable Tax Pools</h2>
        <p>This checkbox allows tax pool information to be turned on or off. If enabled, tax pool information will be used. </p>
        <h2>Use Book Tax (Standalone Tax) at company level only, and Use Book Tax (Standalone Tax) at all levels</h2>
        <p>The deductible amount is limited to the project’s or entity’s available write-off. Book Tax limits the tax deductions allowed in any year to be less than or equal to the taxable income. Therefore, Book Tax does not allow the tax payable to be less than zero. Any available tax deduction exceeding the taxable income in a given year is carried forward to the next year. If applied at company level, Book Tax is applied only when running corporate-level economics. If applied at all levels, book tax is calculated at the company level, as well as each folder level and entity-level. </p>
        <h2>Use Current Tax</h2>
        <p>The full amount of the project’s or entity’s available tax deduction is used, regardless of the amount of taxable income. This can result in a negative tax if the deductions exceed the taxable income. The Current Tax approach allows negative tax based on the assumption that this will be offset by other entities within the corporation which have a positive tax payable in the same time period.</p>
        <h2>Enable Sask. Capital Surcharge</h2>
        <p>If enabled, Saskatchewan Capital Surcharge will be used.</p>
        <h2>US Company Type</h2>
        <p>The company type determines the amortization of capital costs and tax write-offs. </p>
        <p>The three company types to choose from include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Independent</b>: Results in a two-year G&amp;G depreciation, and immediate IDC write-off. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Minor integrated</b>: Results in two-year G&amp;G depreciation and a 70% IDC write-off, with the other 30% being depreciated over 5 years, using the half-year rule.
            </li>
            <li><b>Major Integrated</b>: Results in five-year G&amp;G depreciation and a 70% IDC write-off, with the other 30% being depreciated over five years, using the half-year rule.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An independent company is a purely upstream oil and gas producer, with no refining or retail marketing operations. It does not have more than $5 million in retail sales of oil or gas in a year, and does not refine more than 50,000 barrels of crude a day during the year. </p>
        <p>An integrated minor company has a mid-stream and/or downstream portion. It engages in all phases of the oil and gas industry, from exploration for oil deposits to retail sale of the oil and gas products.</p>
        <p>Integrated major companies are engaged in production, refining, transportation, and marketing. They must have a worldwide ADV of 500,000 barrels of crude oil, gross receipts in excess of $1 billion in the last year, and an ownership interest in a crude oil refiner of 15 percent or more.</p>
