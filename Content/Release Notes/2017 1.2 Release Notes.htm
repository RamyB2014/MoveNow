        <h1>2017 1.2 Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue with O+W forecasts in combination with 1+WOR where the forecast duration could change upon well copying or promotion. This would lead to unbalanced results in the Pending or Accepted copies after promoting from a balanced Working copy.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with the O+W calculation where it would incorrectly determine the point of a max-rate transition. This would manifest in different ways:</li>
            <li>Segment duration shown on the Declines tab not matching the graph</li>
            <li>Final rate (Qf) on O+W segments not always being honoured</li>
            <li>Forecasts terminating at O+W end date instead of oil end date</li>
            <li>Production gaps at segment transitions</li>
        </ul>
