        <h1>Export Security Settings</h1>
        <p>You can export Security Settings for use in another project or for sharing with other users. You can export Security Settings from the Export to File dialog box (accessed by selecting <b>Export</b> from the <b>File</b> menu) or you can export them from the Security Settings dialog box (accessed by selecting <b>Security Settings</b> from the <b>Administration</b> menu). When you export Security Settings from the Security Settings dialog box, the export file only contains Security Settings. However, if you export them from the Export to File dialog box, you can include other project data (see <MadCap:xref href="Export Project Data.htm#Export_Project_Data">Export Project Data</MadCap:xref> for more information). </p>
