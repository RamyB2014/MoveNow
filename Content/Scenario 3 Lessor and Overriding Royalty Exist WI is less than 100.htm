        <h1>Scenario 3: Lessor and Overriding Royalty Exist; WI is less than 100%</h1>
        <p>Mr. Z owns the mineral rights in some land in Texas. He leases this land to Raven Resources, reserving a 1/8 royalty. (12.5%) Raven has a 100% WI. Raven Resources decides they need another investor so in exchange for an investment they offer Investor ING an Overriding Royalty of 1/5 (20%) of Raven Company’s Interest. Raven Company determines they still needs more investment, so they find a partner, JVA Exploration, and assign them a 25% WI. </p>
        <p>Generally speaking, you should select the options below in this scenario: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Option A</b>: Select this if you know your Lease Revenue Interest and the NRI.
            </li>
            <li><b>Option B</b>: Select this if you know the burden information.
            </li>
            <li><b>Option C</b>: Select this if you only have an NRI value.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To enter this case you could use any of the following options:</p>
        <div class="Note"> If you already created the case with a 100% Working Interest (like Scenario 2) then simply changing the WI will recalculate your NRI as required.</div>
        <p>A) Enter the WI, LRI, and NRI (Figure 1)</p>

        <p>Figure 1: The lease royalty % (12.%) and the overriding royalty % (20%) are calculated. </p>
        <p>B) Enter the WI, Lease Royalty Payable, and Overriding Royalty payable (Figure 2)</p>
        <img src="Resources/Images/image027_001.jpg" />
        <p>Figure 2: The LRI and NRI are calculated.</p>
        <p>C) Enter the WI, and the NRI you calculated (Figure 3).</p>

        <p>Figure 3: The lease royalty % (12%) and the overriding royalty % (20%) are calculated.</p>
