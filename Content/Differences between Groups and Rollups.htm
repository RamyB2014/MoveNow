        <h1>Differences between Groups and Rollups</h1>
       <p> Groups are useful for evaluating commingled wells, or when you want to group wells in a unit. Groups are not ideal for entities that have incentives or quantity-based royalties, because the averaging effect could lead to inaccurate results. Rollups are useful for tracking drilling programs. The differences between groups and rollups are described below. </p>
