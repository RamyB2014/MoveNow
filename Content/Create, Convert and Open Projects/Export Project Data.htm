        <p>To export a well list, see <MadCap:xref href="../Importing and Exporting/Export a Well List.htm#Export_a_Well_List">Export a Well List</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <div class="Caution">If you are exporting entities for the purpose of importing them into another <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> project, see <MadCap:xref href="../Importing and Exporting/Merge Projects.htm#Merge_Projects">Merge Projects</MadCap:xref> for important guidelines. </div>
        <h2>Dependencies in the Export List</h2>
        <p>Some items in the Data to export list are dependent on other items. For example, if you select Batch Definitions, Hierarchies is also selected because Batch Definitions are based on a hierarchy. Likewise, Price Decks are dependent on Prices, Royalties, Tax Rates &amp; Price Sets, Countries, and Currencies. If you deselect Currency, for example, Price Decks is deselected automatically because you cannot export a Price Decks without currencies. </p>
        <h2>Exporting Parent and Child Entities</h2>
        <p>When you export a parent entity (an entity that contains other wells, such as a group, rollup, bulk well schedule or a type well) its children are automatically included in the export. </p>
        <p>If you export a well that is a child of a parent entity (such as well used to create a type well), the parent is not automatically exported. </p>
        <h2>Exporting a Default Project Options File</h2>
        <p>If you are creating a default project data file, deselect all options that you do not want to include in the file. Usually, you will only want to include the <b>Project Options</b> and the desired <b>Project Data</b> selections. However if you want the same price deck used in all new projects, ensure you include it in your export.</p>
        <h2>Exporting Linked Entities</h2>
        <p>When you select <b>All Entities</b> in the <b>Export to File</b> dialog box, all entities are exported and the relationships between them are maintained. </p>
        <p>If you select <b>Filtered Entities</b>, entities related to the filtered entities are exported according to the <b>Entity Data</b> selections in the export.</p>
        <p>If you select <b>Current Selection</b>, entities related to the selected entities are not exported regardless of the <b>Entity Data</b> selections in the export. To export linked entities while using <b>Current Selection</b>, you must create a filter that includes them. For example, to export <b>New Well</b> and include the type well to which it is linked (<b>New Type Well</b>), you need to create the <MadCap:xref href="Create a Filter Query.htm#Create_a_Filter_Query">filter</MadCap:xref> below (or any filter that gives the same results) before exporting. </p>
