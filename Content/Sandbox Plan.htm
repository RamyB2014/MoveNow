        <h1>Sandbox Plan</h1>
        <p>The Sandbox plan is a built-in plan you can use for “what if” scenarios. The Sandbox plan is not included in reserves and does not affect other plans (unless they are children of the Sandbox).</p>
        <p>The Sandbox plan is always a top-level plan. You cannot delete it or make it secure, but you can add new plans to it as children.</p>
        <p>You can copy entities or folders to the Sandbox from the <b>Entity</b> menu (<b>Copy to Sandbox</b>).</p>
        <p class="Warning">When you copy to the Sandbox, any corresponding entity or folder level data already in the Sandbox is overwritten.</p>
