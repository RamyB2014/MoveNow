        <h1>Compare Results Overview</h1>
        <p>On the<b> Comparison </b>tab, you can compare economic or technical data between entities or within different plans or reserves categories in one entity. </p>
        <p>On <b>Comparison | Economic</b>, you can compare production, cash flow, and costs in different archives, reserves plans, calculated plans, reserves categories, and scenarios. </p>
        <p>For economic comparisons, keep in mind that:</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">All results are based on economic calculations and require economics to be run.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Only results after the <MadCap:xref href="Options/Project Options Economics.htm#Economic_Calculation_Start_Date">Economic Calculation Start Date</MadCap:xref> are displayed.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Results are reported on a monthly basis until the <MadCap:xref href="Options/Project Options Economics.htm#Last_Year_for_Monthly_Output">Last Year for Monthly Output</MadCap:xref>. Then results are displayed annually.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Production is based on the entity’s Economic Limit (if that option is enabled).</li>
            <li>On <b>Comparison | Technical</b>, you can compare declines between Reserves Categories and Plans within one entity. </li>
