        <h1>Create Spreadsheet Import Tasks</h1>
        <p>The Spreadsheet Import tool uses import <i>Tasks</i> to hold a set of related data called a <i>Mapping</i>. When you import a spreadsheet you must create a task for each mapping you are importing. For example, you need to create one task to import a capital costs mapping and another task for an operating costs mapping. You can import each task separately or create several tasks and import them all at once. </p>
        <p>When you open the Spreadsheet Import tool, an empty task is already displayed. You can add more tasks by clicking <b>Add Task</b> in the bottom left. When you have more than one task, only the task you are currently editing is visible—all other tasks are collapsed. Click the blue space above a task to expand it. </p>
        <p>The order in which the tasks are imported is important. For example, if you are going to import capital costs for a well, the well must already exist in the project. Therefore, if the well doesn’t exist in the project, you would need to first create a task to import the well and then create a task to import its capital costs. You can only create wells by selecting the <b>Well Information</b> mapping in the Spreadsheet Import tool. </p>
        <p>You can reorder tasks by clicking the up and down arrows in the task’s header. </p>
        <p>The order in which data is entered in each spreadsheet is also important. See <MadCap:xref href="Spreadsheet Creation Guidelines.htm#Spreadsheet_Creation_Guidelines">Spreadsheet Creation Guidelines</MadCap:xref>.</p>
