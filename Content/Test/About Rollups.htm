        <h1>About Rollups</h1>
        <p>Rollups are lists of wells created mainly for viewing the pressure and production history and forecast of several wells. Putting wells into a rollup enables you to view all the wells’ BHP tests, AOF tests, gas analyses, production data, and decline data as one well. </p>
        <p>When a rollup is created, the production history and decline data for each well is summed, as seen on <b>Predictions | Declines.</b> You cannot edit the summed forecast. When wells are in a rollup, each well’s economics are retained. However, rollups do not sum the economic data of each well and you cannot run economics on a rollup. You can run various technical reports, and you can run economics on individual wells within a rollup. </p>
        <p>When you add wells to rollups, the wells are not moved from the general well list. Wells can be included in more than one rollup at a time and in a rollup and a group at the same time. </p>
