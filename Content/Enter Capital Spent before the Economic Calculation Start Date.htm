        <h1>Enter Capital Spent before the Economic Calculation Start Date</h1>
        <p>If unrecovered capital remains prior to the Economic Calculation Start Date, do one of the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Enter the unrecovered capital amount as the Payout Reversion Value
            </li>
            <p>OR</p>
            <li>
                Use the <b>Economics Detail—Before Tax Expanded</b> report to determine when the capital will be recovered and use that date to <MadCap:xref href="Enter Reversions.htm#Enter_Reversions">enter a date reversion</MadCap:xref> rather than a payout reversion.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there are special contracts in place where a capital amount is used for a payout reversion but that amount is not entered in <b>Economics | Prices &amp; Costs | Capital Costs</b>, enter the amount as the <b>Payout Reversion Value</b>. </p>
