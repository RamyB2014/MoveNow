        <h1>Rename an Entity</h1>
        <p>When you rename an entity, keep in mind that: </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Entity names are not case sensitive. Therefore, a name such as <b>NEW WELL</b> cannot be used if the name <b>New Well</b> is already in use. </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Renamed entities retain their globally unique identifier. Data associated with the well does not change when you rename it. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will continue to treat the renamed well as if it was the original well. This behaviour can affect the merging of projects. See <MadCap:xref href="../Importing and Exporting/Merge Projects.htm#Merge_Projects">Merge Projects</MadCap:xref> for more details. </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">You can use the name of a deleted entity, but doing so links the renamed entity with the deleted entity’s reserve reconciliation records (applies only to wells and only in a posted database).</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">The deleted entity’s Vendor ID remains linked to the renamed entity unless you select <b>Delete associated Vendor IDs</b> in the <b>Rename Entity</b> dialog box. Using the correct vendor ID is required for PPDM production updates. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../Update Production/Map Data Vendor IDs.htm#Map_Data_Vendor_IDs">Map Data Vendor IDs.</MadCap:xref></li>
        </ul>
