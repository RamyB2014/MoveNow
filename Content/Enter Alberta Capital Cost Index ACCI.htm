        <h1>Enter Alberta Capital Cost Index (ACCI)</h1>
        <p>Wells in Alberta that operate under the Modernized Royalty Framework will have the ACCI applied when royalties are calculated.</p>
        <div class="Note">The C* value calculated on the <b>Interests and Royalties</b> tab is not factored by ACCI. The ACCCI is applied when economics are run.</div>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To enter the ACCI</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                On the <b>Tools</b> menu, point to <b>Global Project Data</b> and select <b>Price Decks</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the active price deck (and any scenario price decks), select <b>Tax Rates</b> and browse to <b>Alberta Capital Cost Index</b>.
            </li>
            <li>

        <p>The ACCI tracks year-over-year inflationary or deflationary changes in the industry. The ACCI will initially be set to 100% in 2017, and allowed to “float” on an annual basis as a function of changes in industry costs. The value will be periodically modified by the Alberta government.</p>
