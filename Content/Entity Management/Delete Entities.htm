        <h1>Delete Entities</h1>
        <p>When entities are deleted from a posted (reserves) database, they are not entirely removed from the database. Deleted entities are removed from all Explorer views except the Deleted Wells view (which does not display deleted Groups or Rollups) which you can select from the Entity Type list in the Standard toolbar. Only deleted wells with change records are displayed in the Deleted Entities view. </p>
        <p>Be advised that: </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Deleted entities cannot be undeleted.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">The names of deleted entities can be reused, but reusing the name links the new well to the deleted entity’s reserve reconciliation records. </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">When groups and rollups are deleted, the wells inside them are not deleted. </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">If the well you are deleting is a source well for a well schedule, deleting it makes the schedule uneditable. </li>
        </ul>
