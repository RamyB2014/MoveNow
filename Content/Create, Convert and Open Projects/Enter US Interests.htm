        <h1>Enter US Interests</h1>
        <p>Enter interests on <b>Economics | Interests &amp; Royalties</b>. </p>
        <p>To select which interests are displayed, click the <b>Interest Properties</b> list at the top of the screen and select the interests from the list. Working Interest, and Net Revenue Interest are always displayed. </p>

        <h2>US ownership details </h2>
        <p>When you select a US entity and go to <b>Economics | Interests &amp;Royalties</b>, two US-specific ownership interests are displayed: </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li><b>Lease Revenue Interest (LRI):</b> The total amount of revenue interest available for the case. This is the Royalty Interest value for a 100% Working Interest and it is used in the calculation of the NRI value and the value of the Lessor Royalty Payable.
            </li>
            <li><b>Net Revenue Interest (NRI)</b>: The owner’s share in the Production and Revenue. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can enter the NRI or it can be automatically calculated.</p>
        <p>The NRI calculation: </p>
        <p>NRI = WI * [(1-GORp)*(1-NORp)*(1-NPIp)] + (1-WI) * [1 - (1-GORr)*(1-NORr)*(1-NPIr)] </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>
                Changing the WI recalculates the NRI, not the Royalty. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If you enter a Sliding Scale override, a flat number for the NRI can no longer be determined so <b>&lt;Sliding Scale&gt;</b> is displayed.
				
				   </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ownership and Payable/Receivable Grid Interaction</h2>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>
                Entering an LRI generates the equivalent Royalty value in the Burdens section
            </li>
            <li>
                Entering an NRI generates the equivalent Overriding Royalty value in the Burdens section
            </li>
            <li>
                Entering a Royalty % Burdens calculates the equivalent LRI
            </li>
            <li>
                Receivables are always considered in the NRI calculation on the Grid unless the WI is 0. Receivables are always considered in the final calculations on the output reports.
            </li>
        </ul>
