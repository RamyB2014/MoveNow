        <h1>Secure Plans</h1>
        <p>When you create a plan, you can specify it as secure. See <MadCap:xref href="Create, Convert and Open Projects/Create a Plan.htm">Create a Plan</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Only users with the Edit Secure Plan Data security policy are able to edit secure plans. See <MadCap:xref href="Create, Convert and Open Projects/Assign Policies to Users and Roles.htm">Assign Policies to Users and Roles</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>When you add the Edit Secure Plan Data security policy to a user or a role, you must specify whether you want to include all secure plans or only some, using three options: All Plans, Includes, and Excludes (see below).</p>
        <p class="Warning">Changing certain entity information, such as an entity’s country or product list, might result in changes to the plan data. Adding entities to entity containers (such as groups, ring fences, or common termination entities) can also affect economic results in secure plans.</p>
