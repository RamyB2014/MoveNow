        <h1>Open and Edit Spreadsheet Import Spreadsheets</h1>
        <p>In the Spreadsheet Import tool, you can open .<b>xlsx</b>, <b>.xlsm</b>, or .<b>csv</b> files. Once you have opened the file, you can also select the Sheet you want to import. </p>
        <p>The data displayed in the Spreadsheet Import tool is only a preview. </p>
        <p>If you need to edit the data, you must open the spreadsheet, edit it, click <b>Save</b>, and then click <img src="Resources/Images/image023.png" class="InlineImage" />&#160;in the Spreadsheet Import tool to refresh the preview. You can open the spreadsheet from the Spreadsheet Import tool by clicking <img src="Resources/Images/image021.png" class="InlineImage" />&#160;next to the <b>Sheet</b> list. </p>
        <p>Your spreadsheet will contain column headings that are not part of the data you want to import. To exclude those rows, in the Spreadsheet Import tool, enter the number of rows to be excluded in <b>Header rows</b> (below the preview). </p>
