        <h1>2018 Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>Installation Changes</h2>
        <p>As of version 2018, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> no longer supports a 32 bit installation.</p>
        <h2>Schema Changes</h2>
        <p>See the <i>Database Administration</i> folder of the release package for schema changes.</p>
        <h2>Upgrade Changes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Modified database upgrade procedure to automatically turn off query timeouts. This enables very large database upgrades to succeed without requiring config file changes.</li>
            <li>Added a cleanup query on upgrade to remove orphaned records in the ENT_RELATIONSHIP table.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <h3><a name="Automate"></a>Automated Reserves Reconciliation</h3>
        <p>We’ve added <a href="../Create, Convert and Open Projects/Automated Reserves Reconciliation Overview.htm">automated reserves reconciliation</a> (ARR), which is designed to simplify reconciliations by eliminating the need to manually create a change record each time you modify an entity. With ARR enabled, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> detects the changes you made and creates the required change records when you click Reconcile (on <b>Review | Change Records</b> or <b>Review | Waterfall</b>).</p>
        <p>Automated reserves reconciliation is enabled by default in any project created in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018 (you can still create change records manually using the Balance button). However, ARR is not enabled by default in any project upgraded to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018 or later. For upgraded projects, you must enable ARR in the project options.</p>
        <p>You can only enable ARR on upgraded projects with data in the Accepted plan</p>
        <h3><a name="Reserves"></a>Reserves Category Transfer Tool</h3>
        <p>We’ve add a <a href="../Transfer Reserves Category Data.htm">Category Transfer tool</a> to the Data Manager (<b>Entity</b> menu &gt; <b>Data Manager</b>).</p>
        <p>The Category Transfer tool simplifies the process of copying a well from one reserves category to another (from PUD to PDP, for example).</p>
        <p>The tool:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transfers the entity from one reserves category to another and removes the inputs from the source category</li>
            <li>Creates a change record for the transfer</li>
            <li>Creates a change record for the revisions</li>
            <li>Balances the entity before or after the transfer, depending on the option you select</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Waterfal"></a>Waterfall Chart</h3>
        <p>We’ve added a <a href="../View the Waterfall Chart.htm">Waterfall chart</a> (<b>Review | Waterfall</b>). The chart displays opening balances, changes, and current reserves balances in a waterfall format. The chart displays entity or folder level results.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/waterfallchart.png" />
        </p>
        <h3><a name="Secure"></a>Secure Plans</h3>
        <p>We’ve added the ability to <a href="../Secure Plans.htm">mark plans as secure</a>. We’ve also added a supporting security policy called Edit Secure Plan Data for assigning permission to users. This policy can be edited to specify which secure plans the user or role has permission to edit.</p>
        <h3>Sandbox Plan</h3>
        <p>We’ve added a built-in <a href="../Sandbox Plan.htm">Sandbox plan</a> for “what if” scenarios.</p>
        <p>This plan does not participate in the reserves process. The Sandbox plan is always a top-level plan. You cannot delete it or make it secure. However, you can add child plans to it.</p>
        <p>There is a Copy to Sandbox menu item under the Entity menu. You an copy entities or folders to the Sandbox from other plans. When you copy to the Sandbox, any corresponding entity or folder level data already in the Sandbox is overwritten.</p>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <h3>Gross Change Records</h3>
        <p>We’ve added a Gross basis to the list of ownership variants for which we capture and report change record data. Also known as ‘eight-eighths’, it is required for EIA 23 disclosures in the United States and helps give you a more complete version of your reserves.</p>
        <h3>Gross values are tracked with both the Balance command and the new Reconcile command.</h3>
        <p>Databases that are upgraded to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> 2018 will not have gross opening balances created on any wells. Gross opening balances can be imported via the Spreadsheet Import, if desired. If not, the first change records created after the upgrade will capture the full current value of the well on a gross basis.</p>
        <h3>Hierarchy Depth in the Report Designer</h3>
        <p>We’ve added Hierarchy Depth to Hierarchy Tables in the Report Designer. This enables you to control the level of aggregation in the hierarchy-based reports.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/hierarchy depth.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Display Auto-fit Source Points in Custom Graphs</h3>
        <p>We’ve added an Auto-fit Source Points display option to custom graphs. This option displays the auto-fit points on the source data rather than on the fit line. This option has not been added to the default graphs.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/autofitsource.png" />
        </p>
        <h3><a name="Control"></a>Control Auto-running Reports</h3>
        <p>We’ve added an Auto-run option to the <b>Reports</b> tab. When deselected, reports are not automatically run when you click the Reports tab.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/autorun.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Other Enhancements</h2>
        <h3>User and Project Options</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a new project option to display or hide report page borders.</li>
            <li>Added a new project option to display or hide report titles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reports</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added the Root Group field to all entity-level custom reporter queries.</li>
            <li>Added new option for the Change Record Summary and Reserves Reconciliation reports to show oil and gas reserves product details or show only rolled-up 'All Oil' and 'All Gas' variants.</li>
            <li>Added a new option to the Change Record Summary report to include condensate volumes in the liquids, including the liquids summary when details are not shown.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interests and Royalties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Revisions to Saskatchewan gas royalties:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>o	Formerly, royalties would calculate on sales gas &amp; liquids – now only calculates on raw gas</p>
        <p>o	Added new royalty price stream for PGP, in $/energy (i.e., $/GJ or $/MMBTU) – previous price was only in $/volume ($/Mcf or $/103m3). If new price is not populated in the price deck, will fall back to volume-based pricing.</p>
        <p>o	Formerly, gas royalties would be valued based on the wellhead sales price – now valued based on the PGP, accounting for the raw gas energy content</p>
        <p>o	Other tweaks to royalty rate calculations (e.g., handling PGP below the $1.35/GJ Kg formula threshold, per PR-IC02 secction III (f)).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Condensate now included in BC PCOS calculations.</li>
            <li>BC PCOS deductions are now limited to 95% of the gross royalty.</li>
            <li>Input Copier has new selections for Reserves Category Royalty Properties and Reserves Category Tax</li>
            <li>Updated Alberta meter station factors for 2018, per Information Letter IL-2018-09.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a the Well Detective to the main toolbar (previously only in  the Tools menu).</li>
            <li>Updated the behaviour of the Project Start Date, such that modifications to the project start will only be carried through to parallel rescats if the parallel start dates are in sync (i.e., the same as the date being revised). This will better support having separate 1P/2P/3P schedules when using our new behind-pipe scheduling plug-in.</li>
            <li>Updated the Update/Delete Change Records plug-in to support change records generated as part of automated reconciliation.</li>
            <li>Added Release Notes for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> versions 2016 to 2018 to the Help (Help menu &gt; Contents or press F1).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a crash on the Declines tab when attempting to draw a decline profile on a series with no points.</li>
            <li>Fixed an error in the auto-fitting routines that could sometimes cause a crash.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue with 1+WOR declines used in concert with O+W constant values, where the 1+WOR ax rate was incorrectly used instead of the O+W constant rate.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue on the Plant tab, where imported liquids history would not be used if a default liquid extraction (ratio or efficiency) was entered.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Economic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed an issue where moving forward the reference date (and thus the discount date) would cause NPV amounts on the Change Records tab to not include current period values (i.e., the amount between prior posting and reference date).</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where wells that went uneconomic between the economic calculation date and the reference date would not have any values on the Change Records tab. They will now have the values for the period of time between the prior posting date and their economic limit. This will also impact dispositions modeled with an interest end date.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue when copying incremental capital or operating costs between plans or reserves categories, where the costs could be doubled in the destination.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed the Open as spreadsheet functionality to prevent occasional failures to open spreadsheets if Excel was already running.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where external data source files would be seen as invalid if they had uppercase file extensions.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where editing CTE options would not cause values on the Change Record tab to be updated.</li>
            <li>Fixed the Generate forecast from last production month import user option, which previously would generate from the current month when checked, and last production month when unchecked, which was backwards.</li>
            <li>Fixed MRF wells with liquids extraction where <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> would sometimes have used the inlet composition for C5, C6, and C7+ in determining gas energy content. It will now correctly use the step outlet composition, with these products adjusted for C5+ extraction as modeled on the Plant tab.</li>
            <li>Updated the XML import to resolve certain classes of name conflicts, where a well with the same UWI was created separately in two databases and then imported between them. Previously, it would reject the import but now will give the duplicate well a safe name and bring it in. This applies not just to wells, but to all entities (well, groups, type wells, schedules, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Included Plug-ins</h2>
        <p>Many of our clients have been using plugins to augment specific functionality in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. We have included four of our most popular plugins with the download for 2018. Descriptions of these plugins are below. If you wish to use any of these in your company, they must be loaded manually for each user who wants to use them. Contact Support for assistance with this.</p>
        <p>Plug-ins, and their accompanying documentation, available in the folder are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Schedule Adjustment</b>: Changes the timing of the forecast start date, capital costs, and operating costs, while maintaining the time relationships between costs.</li>
            <li><b>Delete Production</b> Deletes historical production that may have been imported incorrectly.</li>
            <li><b>Edit/Delete Change Records</b>: View all current change records in a database and delete them or edit their properties.</li>
            <li><b>Behind-pipe Scheduling</b>: Reschedule a set of wells, in sequence, such that each well’s start date is synchronized with the prior well’s economic limit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <p>If you are connecting to an Access database to import External Data into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you will not be able to do this with the 64-bit installation. 64-bit compile will not support connections to Access currently. If you run into this issue, please contact Support and let them know to pass this on to Development so we can determine if a fix is required for this issue in future releases of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>Please check the Client section of our website, <a href="http://www.energynavigator.com/clients" target="_blank">www.energynavigator.com/clients</a>, for updates on this and other important information</p>
