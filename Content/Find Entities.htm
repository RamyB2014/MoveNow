        <h1>Find Entities</h1>
        <p>The Find function can be used to locate wells in a project or to find wells when you have moved from one Explorer view to another (e.g. from Entity Hierarchy to Wells). </p>
        <p>The Find function can be accessed by:</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>
               Selecting <b>Find</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu
            </li>
            <li>
               Right-clicking in the Explorer and selecting <b>Find</b></li>
            <li>
                Pressing <b>F3</b> (for new searches only). See <b>Using the F3 Key to Find Wells</b>, below.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To find a well</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click <b>Find</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select the search format you want to use. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter the well name or UWID (an asterisk can be used as a wildcard).
            </li>
            <li>
                Click Find <b>Next</b> or <b>Find All</b>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the well is found, it is highlighted in the Explorer and it is listed in the bottom of the Find dialog box. </p>
        <h2>Using the F3 Key to Find Wells</h2>
        <p>Once you complete a search in the Find dialog box, it is saved in memory until another search is entered or <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is shut down. Pressing the <b>F3</b> key performs the saved search without reopening the <b>Find</b> dialog box. If the saved search returned more than one well, pressing <b>F3</b> scrolls through the wells in the same way as <b>Find Next</b>. </p>
        <p>Pressing <b>Ctrl+F3</b> saves the current well to the Find memory so that the same well can be found quickly again later. For example, if you are in the Entity Hierarchy view and press <b>Ctrl+F3</b>, then later you are in the <b>Data View</b> and want to find the same well, pressing <b>F3</b> will find the well. </p>
        <div class="Note">If the <b>Find</b> dialog box is open when you press the <b>F3</b> key to save a well, the well will not be saved to the Find memory. Close the <b>Find</b> box before pressing F3. </div>
