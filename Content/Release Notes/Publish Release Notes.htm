        <h1><a name="top"></a>Publish Release Notes</h1>
        <p>Release notes should be made available each release as a topic under Release Notes, which is linked to from the home page and as a PDF in the Release Notes topic.</p>
        <p>Follow these guidelines for release notes:&#160;</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>Create a new book in the TOC named <b>Release Notes</b>.</li>
            <li>Create a topic for each release named <i style="font-weight: bold;">Version Number/Name</i><b> Release Notes</b>. </li>
            <li>Create one topic called <b>Release Notes PDFs</b> and put all PDFs in that topic, with the most recent first. </li>
            <li>From each Release Notes topic, add a link on the first line to the Release Notes PDFs topic like this:&#160;<b>For a PDF version, see Release Notes PDFs</b>.</li>
            <li>Create a link on the home page named <i style="font-weight: bold;">Version Number/Name</i><b>Release Notes</b>.</li>
            <li>When describing a new feature in the release notes, link to the relevant topic or topics in the help.</li>
