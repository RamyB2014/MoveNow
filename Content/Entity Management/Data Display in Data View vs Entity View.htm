        <h1>Data Display in Data View vs. Entity View</h1>
        <p>The way data is displayed in Data View is different than the behaviour in Entity View. </p>
        <p>Data View only displays <i>user-entered values</i> (inputs) from Entity View. User-entered values include values entered in Common or overrides entered in any other reserves category. Data View does not display values <i>inherited</i> from other plans or reserves categories (resolved data). </p>
        <p>For example, if you enter a Common cost in Entity View, it is displayed in other reserves categories as an inherited value. However, in Data View, that same cost is only displayed in Common. </p>
