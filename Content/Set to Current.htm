        <h1>Set to Current</h1>
        <p>The <b>Set to Current</b> button on <b>Predictions | Declines</b> (click <img src="Resources/Images/image054.jpg" class="InlineImage" />) extrapolates an existing forecast out to the <MadCap:xref href="Create, Convert and Open Projects/Set the Current Month.htm#Set_the_Current_Month">Current Month</MadCap:xref> + 1.</p>
        <p>Use <b>Set to Current</b> in conjunction with the <b>Properties</b> tab (bottom left corner of the screen) to easily see if there is a difference between the <b>Last Production Month</b> and the <b>Current Month</b>. If they are different, the forecast might need to be adjusted to account for the downtime or removed if the well has been shut in or abandoned. </p>
        <p>You can move the <MadCap:xref href="Entity Management/Use the Summary Properties and Inputs Windows.htm#Use_the_Summary_Properties_and_Inputs_Windows" target="_popup">Properties tab</MadCap:xref> to a different location on your current screen or to a separate monitor. Selecting the <b>Current Month</b> field on the <b>Properties</b> tab keeps these rows in focus while you move from entity to entity. </p>
        <p>You can also use the <MadCap:xref href="Set the Start of Forecast.htm#Set_the_Start_of_Forecast">Set Start of Forecast</MadCap:xref> tool to move several wells (e.g. wells at a folder level) ahead at once (to the <b>Current Month</b> or to a user-entered date). </p>
