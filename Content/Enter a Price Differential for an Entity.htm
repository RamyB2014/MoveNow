        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To enter a differential for an entity</p>
        <ol class="Procedure">
            <li>
                On <b>Economics | Prices &amp; Costs | Prices</b>, click in the product column you want to add a differential to. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Under <b>Differentials</b>, click <b>Add</b> or right-click and click <b>Add Differential</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the <b>Add Differential</b> dialog box, enter a <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Select a <b>Differential Type</b> and click <b>OK</b>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In the new column, (named <b>Offset</b>, <b>Multiplier</b> or <b>(-) Factor</b>) enter the differential on the date you want it to begin. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="InflationofPriceDif"></a>Inflation of Price Differentials (Offsets)</h2>
        <p>General Inflation applies to offsets in price streams in the price deck, or when applied to an entity on <b>Economics| Prices and Costs | Prices</b>. The inflation occurs monthly. </p>
        <p>The inflation is only applied to offsets when you use sparse data entry. For example, if you enter a one dollar offset in 2012, the general inflation value is applied to all subsequent dates. However, if you enter a one dollar offset for <i>each</i> year from 2012 to 2020, general inflation is not applied to those numbers, but is applied to 2021 and onward. See the examples below. </p>
        <p>If you do not want the offsets inflated at all, or you want to edit the inflation rate, see <MadCap:xref href="Edit Inflation.htm#Edit_Inflation">Edit Inflation</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Example 1</h2>
        <p>In Example 1, a one dollar offset was entered in 2012 only. The one dollar offset was inflated by 2% annually for all subsequent years. </p>

        <h2>Example 2</h2>
        <p>In Example 2, a one dollar offset was entered for each year from 2012 to 2020. The one dollar offset was then inflated by 2% in 2021. </p>
