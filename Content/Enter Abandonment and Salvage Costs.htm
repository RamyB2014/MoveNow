        <h1>Enter Abandonment and Salvage Costs</h1>
        <p>Abandonment and Salvage amounts can be entered in two places: <b>Economics | General</b> and <b>Economics | Prices &amp; Costs | Capital Costs</b>. </p>
        <h2>Abandonment and Salvage in Economics | General</h2>
        <p>Abandonment and salvage amounts entered under <b>Abandonment and Salvage</b> on <b>Economics | General</b> are inflated from the <b>Economic Calculation Start Date</b> according to the rate entered for <b>Capital Cost Inflation</b>. See <MadCap:xref href="Edit Inflation.htm#Edit_Inflation">Edit Inflation</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>The full abandonment and salvage amounts are incurred, regardless of the <b>Chance of Success</b>. However, if the COS is less than 100%, the failure portion is incurred immediately while the remaining amount is incurred after the well becomes uneconomic. If you enter a delay (months) the amounts are incurred that number of months after the well becomes uneconomic. </p>
        <div class="Note">When entering abandonment or salvage costs on a well with no forecast, you must enter the costs as an <MadCap:xref href="Entity Management/Override Inherited Values.htm#Override_Inherited_Values" target="_popup">override</MadCap:xref> in any reserves category other than <MadCap:xref href="Entity Management/Understanding the Common Reserves Category.htm#Understanding_the_Common_Reserves_Category" target="_popup">Common</MadCap:xref>. When abandonment and salvage are entered in Common on a well with no forecast, the costs are not calculated and do not appear in reports. </div>

        <h2>Abandonment and Salvage Amounts in Economics | Prices &amp; Costs | Capital Costs</h2>

        <p>If a Chance of Success is entered on <b>Economics | General</b> and abandonment or salvage is entered as a failure cost, the failure portion is only incurred on the date that it is entered.
