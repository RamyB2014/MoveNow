        <h1>Insert Rows in a Custom Table Report</h1>
        <p>When editing a table report, you can add rows to the report outline. You can also add titles, report totals, group totals or generic column header rows to act as subtitles for row headers.</p>
        <p>Title rows and column headers are both used to present report titles. Title rows span the width of the report and column headers only span one column. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To insert a row, column header, group total row, or report total row</p>
        <ol class="Procedure">
            <li>Report Editor, right-click the grey area on the left of the report outline and select <b>Insert Row</b>.</li>
            <li>Select a type of row to add and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Group totals and report totals are both used to summarize the numerical data in a report. Group totals are used as subtotals and report totals are used as grand totals. You can use both to display different types of information, such as average, sum, maximum, and count. See <MadCap:xref href="Select Totals in Custom Table.htm">Select Totals in Custom Table Reports</MadCap:xref>. </p>
