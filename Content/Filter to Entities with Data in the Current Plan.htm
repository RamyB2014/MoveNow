        <h1>Filter to Entities with Data in the Current Plan</h1>
        <p>All plans in a project contain the same wells, but all wells in a plan will not necessarily have inputs. </p>
        <p>For example, if you create a standalone plan and then merge only some of the wells in the source plan to the new plan, only those wells have inputs in the new plan—the other wells are displayed, but with no inputs. Or, if you only override values for some wells in a child plan (one that inherits data from another plan), the other wells are displayed, but with no inputs (inherited values are not considered inputs). </p>
        <p>When the plan filter at the top of the hierarchy is enabled, only wells with inputs in the current plan are displayed. This is useful for displaying only the wells you are editing in the current plan.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To filter to entities with data in the currently selected plan</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Click <img src="Resources/Images/a_image022_001.png" class="InlineImage" />&#160;at the top right of the entity explorer. <br />Only entities with data in the current plan are displayed and the icon changes to <img src="Resources/Images/image023_002.png" class="InlineImage" />.
            </li>
            <li>
                To clear the filter, click the icon again.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Note"> If you create entities or edit entity properties that affect the filter results, the results are not automatically updated. Use the Reapply Filter button (<img src="Resources/Images/a_image024.jpg" class="InlineImage" />) to update the results. </div>
