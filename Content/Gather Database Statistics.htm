        <h1>Gather Database Statistics</h1>
        <p>Gather Database Statistics enables a user to optimize the performance of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Oracle and SQLite projects. Gathering database statistics can increase the speed of many operations in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, such as economic calculations, batch operations, and export/import. It accomplishes this by gathering statistics about tables and indices which enables the query optimizer to make better query planning choices. </p>
        <p>Database Statistics are automatically gathered during an economic calculation when a folder level or consolidation calculation requires the calculation of more than 500 entities. In addition, the statistics for a particular table are only calculated if there were no previous statistics or the number of rows stored with the existing statistics differs by more than 10% of the actual number of rows in the table.</p>
        <p>To gather database statistics, click <b>Gather Database</b> <b>Statistics</b> in the <b>Administration</b> menu while in an Oracle or SQLite project. </p>
