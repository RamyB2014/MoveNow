        <h1>Use Proxy Names for Spreadsheet Import</h1>
        <p>In many cases you will import data by UWI. However, you can also target entities by specifying a proxy name instead of a UWI. Proxy names include Vendor ID, API Number, Field, Field Code, Pool, Pool Code, Spreadsheet Fields, or Import Tag. Using a proxy name instead of a UWI can save you time by eliminating the need to create a well list. For example, if you want to add the same capital cost to all wells in <b>Pool 1</b>, you can simply create a row in your spreadsheet for <b>Pool 1</b> and then specify <b>Proxy name- Pool</b> in the Spreadsheet Import tool. All wells in that pool will be updated with the new capital cost. </p>
        <p>If you want to use Vendor IDs to import data, you must first copy the ID into the Spreadsheet Import column of the Vendor IDs dialog box. See <MadCap:xref href="Use Vendor IDs in the Spreadsheet Import.htm#Use_Vendor_IDs_in_the_Spreadsheet_Import">Use Vendor IDs in the Spreadsheet Import</MadCap:xref>. </p>
