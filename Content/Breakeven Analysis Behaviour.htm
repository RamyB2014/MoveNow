        <h1>Break-even Analysis Behaviour</h1>
        <h2>Prices in the Break-even Analysis</h2>
        <div class="Note"> For the purpose of performing the BEA, prices, entities, overrides, and differentials are altered as described below. These changes are performed on copies of the entities and prices. The changes are not saved in the database. Only the calculation results are saved. </div>
        <p>The active price deck and entities (as they are loaded) are flattened and all overrides and differentials after the reference date are removed. General inflation overrides are also flattened. Prices are set up with overrides at the reference date (or before if that value continues sparsely) to be factored by adding a % differential. This means that prices that only have differentials from parent prices are not themselves factored but change as a result of their relation to the parent factoring. For each iteration, each of these prices is factored by the same amount. Resulting entity prices and benchmark prices can then be pulled directly and reported. </p>
        <p>Since the NPV changes depending on product price and on par and reference pricing, the analysis scales par and reference prices simultaneously. Royalty prices scaled include:</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Alberta ISC Reference prices</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Alberta Par prices</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Alberta Reference prices</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Alberta Transportation adjustments</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Alberta WTI Royalty price</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">British Columbia PMP prices</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Saskatchewan Par prices</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Saskatchewan provincial gas price (PGP)</li>
            <li>The BEA does not scale:</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">British Columbia Gas Select price</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">British Columbia Oil Threshold prices</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Saskatchewan Gas Cost Allowance</li>
            <li>Pricing Units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The units displayed for product prices when displaying BEA results can vary depending on whether you are resting on a well, or on a folder, and whether you are the analysis on a single entity (Break-even tab) or on multiple entities (<b>Comparison</b> tab).</p>
        <p>On the <b>Break-even</b> tab, the entity currency is always be honoured. When generating folder-level results, the project currency is always be used.</p>
        <p>On the <b>Comparison</b> tab, results are displayed on each entity in the folder. If all entities within a folder are using the same currency, then the entity results and the folder results will be run using the same currency.</p>
        <p>The units displayed for benchmark prices depend on the units used for the benchmark itself within the price deck.</p>
        <h2>Break-even on a Single Entity</h2>
        <p>On a single entity, the steps for determining break-even are:</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">All product prices at the reference date are flattened for the life of the well</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">The selected options are used </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">The process begins by factoring the product price or prices (starting at 100%) to determine the NPV value</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Depending on the nearness to NPV = 0, a new factor is chosen</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">All prices are factored by this new factor, again determining the NPV</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Factoring continues until NPV = 0 is achieved. This is the break-even price.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When determining the break-even price, there is a $500 tolerance on the resulting NPV, which means the analysis stops running further iterations once the resulting NPV is within $500 plus or minus zero. This is to prevent the same break-even results from appearing multiple times as the NPV reaches zero.&#160; </p>
        <p>If the resulting NPV reaches zero exactly, the analysis continues to iterate until it finds a positive NPV that is within a 0.1% factor of the closest zero result. The analysis does this because an NPV = 0 probably indicates that the case has gone uneconomic at that price and so it needs to continue to look for the exact price at which the case reaches NPV = 0. </p>
        <h2>Break-even on a Folder</h2>
        <p>When running break-even analysis on a folder, there are two different types of results: consolidated folder results (Break-even tab) or individual entity results (Comparison tab).</p>
        <p>On a folder, steps for determining a consolidated break-even are: </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Take all product prices for each entity within the folder at the reference date and flatten these prices for the life of the entities</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">The process begins by factoring the product price or prices for each entity (starting at 100%) to determine the NPV value for each entity at that factored price</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">The resulting NPVs for each entity within the folder are summed into a consolidated NPV</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Depending on the nearness to NPV = 0, a new factor is selected</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">All prices for each entity are then factored by this new factor, again determining the NPV for each individual entity, again summing the results into a consolidated NPV for the folder</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">Factoring continues until a summed or consolidated NPV reaches 0. This is the break-even price for the consolidated folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since entities within a folder can possibly have differing prices, it is essential to select a Benchmark price when running a consolidated BEA on a folder in order to bring the break-even price back to a common denominator.</p>
        <p>On a folder, steps for running the individual entity results are similar to determining break-even on a single entity, as noted above.</p>
        <h2>Economic Limit Behaviour</h2>
        <p>When running a break-even analysis, you can choose to honour or ignore the economic limit setting on the entity.&#160; </p>
        <p>When running a BEA, the economic limit always applies to cash flow, so the option to apply the economic limit to net operating income or before tax cash flow is not relevant. </p>
        <p>Honouring an economic limit means that you are finding a break-even price—a price below which the entity becomes uneconomic to operate. </p>
        <p>Ignoring the economic limit allows a break-even price to be calculated assuming that the well would run out to its technical limit, and that all costs to that point will be considered for determining the lowest price at which the maximum volume can be economically produced from the well.</p>
        <h2>Break-even on a Common Termination Entity</h2>
        <p>A BEA can only be run on a Common Termination Entity (CTE) while in the CTE view. Running a BEA on a CTE is similar to running a folder consolidation, which looks for the price at which the summed total of all NPVs of the child entities reaches zero.&#160; </p>
        <p>While running break-even for a CTE, the common termination date is re-calculated with all child entity prices flattened and factored, for each iteration. If you have entered a Manual Termination date, then this date is considered, and the iterations are run within this constraint.&#160; </p>
        <p>CTE entities have logic of their own, in that you can choose to honour or ignore the economic limit of the child wells and of the CTE itself. Since there is a setting in the BEA to honour or ignore the economic limit settings on an entity or a folder, the CTE should be treated similar to an entity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Break-even on a child entity of a CTE<br /></b>Running a BEA on a child entity of a CTE is different than a normal entity. The analysis does not try to find when NPV reaches zero. Instead, it runs the full CTE break-even analysis including all child entities and cost entities in order to find the break-even factor. Then, using that factor, it runs the child entity results and reports that as the break-even price. </li>
            <li><b>Break-even on a folder that contains a child entity of a CTE<br /></b>The BEA runs like a normal folder consolidation, but for each iteration a common termination date is calculated for any CTE entities and this is used to calculate the NPV.</li>
        </ul>
