        <h1>Map Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>Map</b> tab is used for viewing the geographical position of wells and other entities. To view these items, they must have latitude and longitude data. </p>
        <div class="Note">The map is a web-based tool. As such, an internet connection is required to use this feature. The first time you view the map/grid, the data is stored locally (cached) on your computer. The map/grid will be displayed more quickly after the first use.</div>
