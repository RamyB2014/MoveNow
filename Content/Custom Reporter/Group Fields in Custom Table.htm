        <h1>Group Fields in Custom Table Reports</h1>
        <p>Grouping fields in a report makes the report easier to read by separating the results into groups. For example, you can group the data by Date (day, week, month, quarter, or year). Adding groups to a report also gives you the ability to display subtotals. </p>
        <p><b>To add a group field to a report object</b>: In the Report Editor, drag fields from the Fields and Formulas window and drop them into the Groups window.</p>
        <p>The fields that you drop in the Group Fields window also appear in the Sort Fields window, where they can be assigned an ascending or descending sort order. </p>
        <p>Group Fields can also be summarized or nested. See <MadCap:xref href="Summarize Grouped Fields in.htm">Summarize Grouped Fields in Custom Table Reports</MadCap:xref> and<MadCap:xref href="Nest Group Fields in Custom_1.htm"> Nest Group Fields in Custom Graph Reports</MadCap:xref>.</p>
