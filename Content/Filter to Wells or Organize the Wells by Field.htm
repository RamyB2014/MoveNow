        <h1>Filter to Wells or Organize the Wells by Field</h1>
        <p>Before creating a Common Termination Entity (CTE), you can do one of the following: </p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li>Organize your wells by Field (see <MadCap:xref href="Entity Management/Create or Edit an Entity Hierarchy.htm#Create_or_Edit_an_Entity_Hierarchy" target="_popup">Create or Edit an Entity Hierarchy</MadCap:xref>) and then create a cost entity based on the wells in the Field folder. </li>
            <li>Create a cost entity and then filter to the cost entity and the wells you want to include in the CTE (and then create the CTE from those entities). </li>
        </ul>
