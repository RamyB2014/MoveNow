        <h1>Edit Data in Data View and How it Affects Entity Views</h1>
        <p>Since Data View only displays inputs (Common values when viewing Common or values entered as overrides in other reserves categories), you can only edit Common Values (only when viewing Common) or overrides. You cannot edit values inherited from Common (resolved data). </p>
        <p>In Data View:</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">If you <b>edit a Common value</b>, or add a new value in an empty cell, the Common Value is also edited (or added) in Entity View. Also, the new Common value will be inherited in all other reserves categories in Entity View (unless an override has already been entered). </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 0pt;text-indent: 0pt;">If you <b>edit a value in any reserves category other than Common</b>, or add a new value in an empty cell, the new value is edited (or added) in the Entity View as an override. </li>
        </ul>
