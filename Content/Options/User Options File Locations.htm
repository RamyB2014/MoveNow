        <h1>User Options: File Locations</h1>
        <h2>Report and Graph Definitions</h2>
        <p><b>Local Files Directory</b>: This is the location for local (personal) reports and graphs. Custom reports and graphs are saved in a Reports or Graphs folder saved in this location. The default location is C:\. </p>
        <p><b>Shared Files Directory</b>: This is the location for shared reports and graphs. Custom reports and graphs are saved in a Reports or Graphs folder saved in this location. The default location is the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> installation directory. You must specify a shared drive to share reports. </p>
        <p>When you save your first report or graph, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> creates a folder named <b>Reports</b> or Graphs in the Local Files or Shared Files Directory. These folders are not visible from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> interface when you save reports or graphs, as reports are automatically saved in the reports folder and graphs are automatically saved in the graphs folder. If you change the Local Files or Shared Files Directories, you must move these Reports and Graphs folders to the new locations in order to see the reports or graphs you previously created. </p>
        <h2>Project Default Directories</h2>
        <p><b>Data Directory</b>: This is the default location for browsing to a source file from the Project Launcher (when you select Create from Import). </p>
        <p><b>Project Directory</b>: This is the default location for saving or opening projects in the Project Launcher (when you select Create New Project or Browse). </p>
        <h2>Default Project Data File</h2>
        <p>To ensure projects have consistently configured Project Options and/or project data you can select a ValNavProjectOptions file or an .xml file that contains settings that are applied to all new projects you create. </p>
        <p>Note that selecting a default project data file does not apply its settings to your current or past projects. The file is only applied to projects you create after specifying the file. If you want to apply external project settings to your current project, see <MadCap:xref href="Project Options External Project Data.htm#Project_Options_External_Project_Data">Project Options: External Project Data</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <div class="Note"> Once you specify a default project data file, the file path is displayed in the Default Project Data File field for all projects (current, past, and new), but its settings are only applied to projects created since the file was specified. </div>
        <p>To create a default project data file, see <MadCap:xref href="../Importing and Exporting/Export Project Options.htm#Export_Project_Options">Export Project Options</MadCap:xref>. </p>
