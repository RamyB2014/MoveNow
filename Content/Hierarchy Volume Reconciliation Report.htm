        <h1>Hierarchy Volume Reconciliation Report</h1>
        <p>The Hierarchy Volume Reconciliation Report summarizes and organizes change records according to the Entity Hierarchy and displays the results in eight change record categories. To view this report, you must export it as a .csv or .html file.</p>
        <p>You can run the report on the entire hierarchy or on a portion of the hierarchy. You can filter the hierarchy to the desired folders in the Explorer before running the report, but you can also select folder from the hierarchy displayed in the report’s dialog box. Selecting a folder in the dialog box and clicking the <b>Export</b> button generates a report for only that folder.</p>
        <p>Economic data from all relevant reserves categories must be current to produce accurate results. If economic data is not current when you run a reserves report, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> runs economics automatically when you run the report. However, if you want to run reserves economics before running the reserves report, you must run the <i>Reserves Options Scenario</i> on the <b>Reports</b> tab or in the Batch Manager for the entities you want to report on. If you run the <i>Reserves Options Scenario</i> prior to running reserves reports, the reports automatically detect this and will not run it again, resulting in faster display of the report. Running the <i>Default Scenario</i> does not necessarily generate the economic results required to run reserves reports.</p>
