        <h1>Products</h1>
        <p>By default, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is configured to enable forecasting on 13 products, such as oil, gas, water, C2, and NGLs. However, you can also create custom products, assign them ratios, enable decline analysis, assign them import codes, and include them in reserves, if required. </p>
        <p>All products are assignable to product lists. There are three default product lists (gas, oil, and condensate), but you can create custom product lists and add your custom products to them. You then assign product lists to entities. For example, in creating a new gas well, you would specify the Gas product list, which contains products such as Gas, Oil, Water, and C2. </p>
        <div class="Note"> When you create a custom product, you must assign it to a Product List in order to add the custom product to an entity. </div>
