        <h1>Daily Data</h1>
        <p>Daily data handling in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> enables you to import and track daily production rates and volumes. You can use this in the initial months of production, where daily results are often enough to determine the future production profile. Daily data is also used to supplement monthly data to keep production results up to date.</p>
