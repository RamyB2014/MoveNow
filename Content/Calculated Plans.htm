        <h1>Calculated Plans</h1>
        <p>Calculated plans enable you to define calculations between <MadCap:xref href="Plans.htm#Plans">plans</MadCap:xref> and view the incremental results in each reserves category. </p>
        <p>You can view, create, and edit calculated plans on the Calculated Plans tab of the Plans dialog box (<b>Tools</b> &gt; <b>Global Project Data</b> &gt; <b>Plans</b>). </p>
        <h2>Automatically Created Calculated Plans</h2>
        <p>When you create a plan, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically creates a calculated plan with the same name + “Wedge”, as displayed below. </p>
        <img src="Resources/Images/image089.jpg" />
        <p>This automatically created “wedge plan” is already configured to calculate the incremental difference between the plan you created and its parent (in this case “Working”), as displayed below. </p>

        <h2>Calculated Plans Reporting</h2>
        <p>You can report on calculated plans in the same way you can report on plans. </p>
