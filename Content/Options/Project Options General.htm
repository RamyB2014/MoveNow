        <h1>Project Options: General</h1>
        <h2>Company Name</h2>
        <p>This is the name that appears in reports and as the highest level folder in the Entity Hierarchy.</p>
        <h2>Default Scenario Name</h2>
        <p>The default scenario name is &lt;Current Options&gt;. </p>
        <h2>Project Currency</h2>
        <p>The selected default currency is automatically used for the current project (see <MadCap:xref href="../Add a Currency.htm#Add_a_Currency">Add a Currency</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <h2>Project Label</h2>
        <p>This is an alias name for a project. After you re-start the project, the name you enter will appear on the menu bar, before the path of the project.</p>
        <h2>BOE Ratio</h2>
        <p>This is the default ratio that will be used to convert gas to the equivalent barrels of oil.</p>
        <h2><a name="CO2"></a>CO2 Threshold</h2>
        <p>CO2 is left in the gas stream if the percentage is less than the CO2 Threshold. See <MadCap:xref href="../Inlet Outlet Sales and Total Loss Calculations.htm#DefaultPocessLoss">Default Process Loss with CO2 and H2S</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2><a name="CO2Allowable"></a>CO2 Allowable</h2>
        <p>CO2 is removed from the gas stream if it exceeds the CO2 Allowable. See <MadCap:xref href="../Inlet Outlet Sales and Total Loss Calculations.htm#DefaultPocessLoss">Default Process Loss with CO2 and H2S</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2><a name="UseOverlapping"></a>Use Overlapping Production History instead of the Forecast</h2>
        <p>This option determines which production rates to use when generating forecast volumes. If you import production data, but don’t set the forecast start date to the end of production, there is an overlap of history and forecast data. If you enable this option, the production history volumes are used in calculations instead of the forecast volumes.</p>
        <h2>Default Country</h2>
        <p>The country selected here affects the display of fields such as country, state, and province. In projects with United States set as the default country, for example, State will appear as a column header instead of Province. </p>
        <p>The default country is automatically used when creating new wells. This country is also automatically selected in the Countries dialog (Tools &gt; Set up &gt; Countries). </p>
        <h2>Default State/Province</h2>
        <p>The selected default state/province is automatically used when a new well is created. </p>
        <h2>Default Surface Loss</h2>
        <p>This is the default surface loss percentage applied to all new wells added to the current project (shown on <b>Predictions | Declines</b>).</p>
