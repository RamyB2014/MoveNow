        <h1>Scenario 2: Lessor and Overriding Royalty Exist</h1>
        <p>Mr. Z owns the mineral rights in some land in Texas. He leases this land to Raven Resources, reserving a 1/8 royalty. (12.5%) Raven has a 100% WI. Raven Resources decided they need another investor so in exchange for an investment they offer Investor ING an Overriding Royalty of 1/5 (20%) of Raven Company’s Interest.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, you should select the options below in this scenario: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Option A</b>: Select this if you know your Lease Revenue Interest and the NRI.
            </li>
            <li><b>Option B</b>: Select this if you know the burden information.
            </li>
            <li><b>Option C</b>: Select this if you only have an NRI value.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To enter this case you could use any of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A)&#160; Enter the Lease Revenue Interest (LRI) and the Net Revenue Interest (NRI) you already calculated (Figure 1).
            </li>

            <p>Figure 1: Enter the LRI (87.5) and the NRI (70)</p>
            <p>In Option 1, the Lease Royalty % is calculated: <b>100%-LRI%=12.5%.</b></p>
            <p>The Overriding Royalty is also calculated: <b>(I-NRI/WI(I-royaltypay))= 20%</b></p>
            <li>
                B)&#160; Enter the Lease Royalty % Payable (12.5%) and the Overriding Royalty Payable (20%) (Figure 2).
            </li>

            <p>Figure 2</p>
            <p>The LRI and NRI are calculated. </p>
            <li>
                C)&#160; Enter the NRI you calculated (Figure 3)
            </li>
            <img src="Resources/Images/a_image025.jpg" />
            <p>Figure 3</p>
            <p>The Overriding Royalty% is calculated: <b>I-(NRI/WI)</b></p>
        </ul>
