        <h1>Plans</h1>
        <p>Plans enable you to use each entity in your database for multiple purposes and share the calculations results with other plans. For example, you could use one entity in a reserves plan and a budgeting plan in the same project.</p>
        <p>Plans look and behave like the reserves plans Working, Pending, and Accepted (formerly called reserves statuses). These three reserves plans still exist in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, but you can now create custom plans. Like reserves plans, plans include technical and economic information about entities. The Comparison tab is a convenient place to see the differences between wells in different plans.</p>
        <h2>Plans Data Inheritance</h2>
        <p>You can create a standalone plan, which does not inherit data from another plan, or you can create a plan that inherits data from other plans (or from Working) in order to reduce data entry and ensure consistent and accurate inputs between plans. To set up data inheritance, you simply specify a plan’s source. Specifying a source plan would enable to you to view entities in a Budgeting plan, for example, that inherit data from the Working plan.</p>
        <p>If you create a standalone plan, you can copy data to it from another plan to use as a starting point. See <MadCap:xref href="Merge Plans.htm#Merge_Plans">Merge Plans</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <div class="Note">If the Plan filter at the top of hierarchy (<img src="Resources/Images/image075_003.jpg" class="InlineImage" />) is enabled, only entities with data in the current plan are displayed.
