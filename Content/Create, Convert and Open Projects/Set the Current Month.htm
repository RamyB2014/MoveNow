        <h1>Set the Current Month</h1>
        <p>The current month is the month to which data is considered current. The current month is displayed on <b>Wells and General Economics | Well Info</b> <b>and Custom Fields</b>. </p>
        <p>The Set Current Month dialog box is displayed when you import data into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> only when the last production date found in the import exceeds the <MadCap:xref href="../Options/User Options Import Parameters.htm#Max_Shut-in_Months" target="_popup">Max Shut-in Months</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p>The current month is used to determine how current the production data is, which enables <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to calculate if a well is shut in. For example, if a production update is performed on June 2009 for 10 wells and 2 wells have production history up to January, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> determines that the those 2 wells have not produced since January. If the Max Shut In Months is set to less than 5 months, the 2 wells are considered shut-in wells. Shut-in wells are not auto-forecasted on import and do not receive an economic case when economics are run. By Default, shut-in wells do not receive data copied to them from the Input Copier.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:xref href="../Options/User Options Import Parameters.htm#Generate_Forecast_from_Last_Production_Month">Generate Forecast from Last Production Month</MadCap:xref> setting affects how the current month is set. If Forecast from Last Production Month is enabled, the current month for wells that are not shut in is set to the last production month. For shut in wells, the current month is set to the last production month. If Forecast from Last Production Month is not enabled, the current month is set to the last production month. See the summary below. </p>

        <p>If you are creating a new project and want all wells to be auto-forecasted, select <b>Generate Forecast from Last Production Month</b> in <MadCap:xref href="../Options/User Options Import Parameters.htm#User_Options_Import_Parameters">User Options: Import Parameters</MadCap:xref>. </p>

        <h2>How the Current Month is Set on New Entities</h2>
        <h3>PPDM</h3>
        <p>If a well is being created during an import or is loading data for the first time from the PPDM, the Current Month is set to the provincial current month found in the PPDM.</p>
        <h3>File imports</h3>
        <p>If a well is being created during an import or is loading data for the first time from a vendor flat file, the Current Month is set to the most recent production date found in the file, unless it is more than 6 months old, in which case it will ask you to select a date to use for Current Month.</p>
        <h2>How the Current Month is Set on Existing Entities</h2>
        <h3>PPDM</h3>
        <p>When using Vendor PPDM data updates, the Current Month indicates the date to which the data is current. The date can be different for each province.</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li><b>For producing entities</b>: The Last Production Month and Current Month are updated to reflect the most recent date and are usually the same.</li>
            <li><b>For shut in or abandoned entities</b>: If a well stops producing and stops reporting, the Last Production Month set in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is not updated. However, the Current Month is updated to reflect the provincial current month.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a well stops producing but continues reporting production volumes as zero, the Last Production Month and Current Month continue to progress together and both are updated. Unfortunately, this can make it more difficult to notice the well is shut in when the dates are current and equal.</p>
        <h3>File Imports</h3>
        <p>If a well is being updated from a vendor flat file, the Current Month is set to the most recent production date found in the file, unless it is more than 6 months old, in which case it will ask you to select a date to use for Current Month.</p>
        <ul class="DoubleSpace">
            <li><b>For producing entities</b>: The Last Production Month and Current Month are updated to reflect the most recent date. The dates are usually be the same.</li>
            <li><b>For shut in or abandoned entities</b>: If a well stops producing and stops reporting, the Last Production Month in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is not updated, but the Current Month is still updated to reflect the current month from the file or as set by the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a well stops producing but continues reporting production volumes as zero, the Last Production Month and Current Month continue to progress together and both are updated.
