        <h1>View Entities on the Map Overview</h1>
        <p>When you select an entity in the Entity Hierarchy, it is displayed on the map as a black dot. Other entities are displayed as white dots (unless Data Visualization is enabled) To select multiple entities, press and hold the <b>Ctrl</b> key while clicking entities in the list.</p>
        <p>When you click an entity on the map, it is highlighted in the Entity Hierarchy. </p>
        <div class="Note">If entities or groups share the same latitude and longitude, an indicator appears beside the UWI to notify you that there is more than one well on that location. Use the <b>Page Up</b> and <b>Page Down</b> keys to scroll through the entities on that location.</div>
