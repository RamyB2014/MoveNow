        <h1>Validate Spreadsheet Import Data</h1>
        <p>Once you are ready to import your data, you should validate it by clicking <b>Validate</b> in the bottom right. Validation helps ensure that you have correctly configured the Spreadsheet Import column headers and that the data can be imported (the wells exist in the project, for example). </p>
        <p>When you click <b>Validate</b>, a log file is created. If you receive a validation error or warning, click <b>Open log</b> next to the <b>Validate</b> button to view the contents. </p>
        <div class="Note">The validation log is only available during the current Spreadsheet Import session. When you close the Spreadsheet Import tool, the log file is not saved. If you need the log file for future reference, click <b>File &gt; Save</b> or <b>Save As</b>. </div>
