        <h1>2017 v2 Release Notes</h1>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>The focus of 2017 v2 is calculation performance, royalty detail reporting, and Arps ratio forecasting.</p>
        <h3>Calculation Performance</h3>
        <p>A major focus of work in 2017 v2 was to realise significant performance gains in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. We have improved the calculation framework to take advantage of hardware configurations in client PC’s that can result in economic runs up to 75% faster than in previous versions.</p>
        <p>Some of these improvements are configurable based on hardware specifications. For further information on 2017 v2 performance features, please contact 3esi-Enersight Support.</p>
        <h3>Royalty Reporting</h3>
        <p>We have added per-product detail on royalty results. Users can now report a detailed breakdown of royalties by product before and after deductions. Royalty rates are now reported as a rate based on royalty pricing, if necessary, instead of sales pricing.</p>
        <p>Two new reports are available: Royalty Detail (Crown) per Product and Royalty Detail (Freehold) per Product. These are also available as templates in Report Designer so users can access all per-product royalty fields.</p>
        <p>Added the per-product royalty fields to the Fiscal Regime editor as formula variables:</p>
        <p>•	Royalty Revenue Summary fields (ex. Gross Royalty Basis Revenue)</p>
        <p>•	Per-product Royalty Revenue fields (ex. Gross Oil Royalty Basis Revenue)</p>
        <p>•	Royalty Paid Summary fields (ex. Total WI Crown Paid)</p>
        <p>•	Per-product Royalty Paid fields (ex. WI Oil Crown Paid)</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Ratio Forecasts</h3>
        <p>Improvements to forecasting to support database conversions and SAGD workflows.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/ratioforecast.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>Conversions</h3>
        <p>Some forecasting software products support time based ratios (i.e. % over time rather than % over volume). This caused issues when converting databases from these products to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> because forecasts based on % over time were not supported.</p>
        <p>Start/End Dates - SAGD</p>
        <p>Start and End Dates are now available for all ratios. End Dates were added to ratios to facilitate forecasting the entire SAGD lifecycle; that is, the ability to forecast early stages of a SAGD project using steam and SOR forecasts, then switching to oil and other injectant forecasts after the steam phase.</p>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <h3>Field Condensate vs Plant Condensate – Alberta</h3>
        <p>Users asked for the ability to designate wellhead condensate as plant C5+ for Alberta royalty purposes.  There is a new option to designate wellhead condensate (or unassigned oil) as either Field Condensate or Plant Condensate.  Plant Condensate will be evaluated using the C5+ royalty calculation.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Allow users to customise minimum Y-axis values for graph scaling</h3>
        <p>Users can now specify both minimum and maximum Y-axis values to provide consistency with graph scales. Previously only the maximum was configurable.  Configure the values from the Predictions tab graph context menu: Graph and Scaling Options &gt; Custom Y Axis Scaling.</p>
        <h3>Licensing Improvements</h3>
        <p>Several improvements to the license web services result in better diagnostic and logging tools.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> users get more user-friendly error messaging and more detail in log files, and licenses are released on errors rather than being used.</p>
        <p>Support for Unicode characters has been added.</p>
        <h3>Rebranded the NavPort data import as RS Prism</h3>
        <p>In 2016, RS Energy Group acquired the production and completion data company NavPort.  The NavPort .vna file import has been updated in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and is now referred to as RS Prism as a Data Source and Vendor ID.</p>
        <h3>Added Command Line production update capability</h3>
        <p>Ctrl+Shift+Right Mouse Click in the 2017 v2 install directory has the option ‘Open Powershell window here’ or ‘Open command window here’.</p>
        <p>A command line instruction can be run from this window to update production values in a specified project.</p>
        <p>Please contact 3esi-Enersight Support.</p>
        <h3>3esi-Enersight Data Integration</h3>
        <p>Energy Navigator was acquired by 3esi-Enersight in June 2017. Significant work has been done since to integrate <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> into the 3esi-Enersight suite of products using data migration tools in the form of plug-ins. 3esi-Enersight products have been added to the Vendors list (Administration &gt; Vendor IDs)</p>
        <p>Please contact 3esi-Enersight Support for a complete list of available plug-ins as these will be made available over the coming months.</p>
        <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <p>•	Fixed a forecast error that could occur with dependent ratio forecasts.  In the case where there are two ratios, and one ratio depends on a product calculated from another ratio, there should be no error. Previously, an error message was displayed ‘There are not enough product forecasts’ and the dependent ratio was not calculated.</p>
        <p>•	Removed the Ei field from Predictions | Workspace data grid.  This was a redundant field from previous versions of best fit routines, and the value reported had no meaning.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue where 1+WOR declines alone could not be created from the Best Fit/Refit dialogue. It is valid for an oil well to have only a 1+WOR forecast, which also forecasts oil.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue where inactive 1+WOR declines were being calculated which resulted in a performance loss. This could occur if a 1+WOR decline automatically became inactive through the addition of a WOR decline.</p>
        <h3>Economic</h3>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue where Fiscal Regime inputs reverted back to original values. This could occur if the value on an input control was returned to a previous value. Other inputs would also revert back to original values.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue where a Gross Overriding Royalty with Operating Cost deductions was not calculated as expected. The Operating Cost was not being factored for the cap percent.</p>
        <h3>Reporting and Graphs</h3>
        <p>•	Fixed a crash that could occur in the Declines | Workspace tab “System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException”.  This could occur when a graph was generated in the workspace with element names longer than 32 characters.</p>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue when a Default scenario (Project Options &gt; General) that was not &lt;Current Options&gt; was not displayed by default in the Comparison | Economic tab.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue where grid values were not displayed as expected. If a data grid Display Mode was set to Monthly and sparse data inputs (i.e. Operating Costs) had different date ranges, the grid might not display all values.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue where project hierarchies could be dropped from the project. If a User Hierarchy was edited to be a Project Hierarchy, it was not saved to the database.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an issue where connections failed for SQL Server databases with periods in the instance name. 'INVALID_SERVER_CHARACTERS' need to be changed to "[^A-Za-z0-9_\\-\\.]"</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an exception that could occur when opening a SQL Server database.  Under certain conditions, project databases were created with a deprecated data type ‘ntext’. This has been updated to ‘nvarchar’.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed an exception that prevented databases being created from XML imports. This could occur when Batch Definitions with reserves categories equal to Common were included in the XML.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed a crash that could occur when creating a new Schedule entity. This could occur when using Entity &gt; Create &gt; Empty Schedule.</p>
        <p>•	Fixed a crash that could occur when editing dropdown field values.  This could occur when toggling values in enforced lists with the keyboard.</p>
        <h2>Plug-ins Included with the Release</h2>
        <p>Many of our clients have been using plugins to augment specific functionality in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. We have included three of our most popular plugins with the download for 2016. Descriptions of these plugins are below. If you wish to use any of these in your company, they must be loaded manually for each user who wants to use them. Contact Support for assistance with this.</p>
        <p>PlugIns, and their accompanying documentation, available in the folder are:</p>
        <p>•	<b>Schedule Adjustment</b>: Changes the timing of the forecast start date, capital costs, and operating costs, while maintaining the time relationships between costs.</p>
        <p>•	<b>Delete Production</b>: Deletes historical production that may have been imported incorrectly.</p>
        <p>•	<b>Edit/Delete Change Records</b>: View all current change records in a database and delete them or edit their properties.</p>
        <p class="Note">Note that workflows previously handled by the Working Interest Import Plugin can all be accomplished in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> using the Spreadsheet Import and Data View tabs, so this plugin will no longer be supported.</p>
        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <p>If you are connecting to an Access database to import External Data into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you will not be able to do this with the 64-bit installation. 64-bit compile will not support connections to Access currently. If you run into this issue, please contact Support and let them know to pass this on to Development so we can determine if a fix is required for this issue in future releases of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
